    severity: high
    finding: "AC10 (Deployed to production) not met - Task 7 has unchecked subtasks (push to main, monitor CI/CD, verify production)"

    severity: medium
    finding: "AC8 (Page loads < 2s on mobile 4G) not validated - Build size good (82.81 kB gzipped) but no Lighthouse audit performed"

    notes: "Static content only, no API exposure, HTTPS enforced via CloudFront, no security concerns"
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Build size excellent (82.81 kB JS gzipped, 2.79 kB CSS gzipped), but no Lighthouse audit performed to validate AC8 (< 2s mobile 4G load time). Missing WebP optimization."
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "No error boundaries or fallback for image load failures - acceptable for MVP coming-soon page, can be enhanced in future stories"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code structure, TypeScript type safety, content extracted to constants during QA review, comprehensive test coverage (22 tests). Improved from original implementation."

refactoring_summary:
  content_extraction:
    file: "src/App.tsx"
    change: "Extracted hard-coded text to CONTENT constant, animation timings to ANIMATIONS configuration"
    benefit: "Easier content updates, internationalization preparation, reduced risk of inconsistent messaging"

    file: "src/App.tsx"
    change: "Added ARIA attributes (role='main', role='img', aria-labels)"
    benefit: "Improved screen reader navigation, WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance"
  test_additions:
    files:
      - "tests/unit/components/App.test.tsx (added 2 accessibility tests)"
      - "tests/unit/seo/meta-tags.test.ts (created 13 SEO validation tests)"
    benefit: "AC9 now has full automated coverage, accessibility compliance validated"
