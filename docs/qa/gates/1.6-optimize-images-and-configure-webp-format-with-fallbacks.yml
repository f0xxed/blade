# Code quality highlights
strengths:
  - "Picture element implementation follows HTML best practices (WebP source before fallback)"
  - "Responsive images use proper width descriptors (640w, 1024w, 1920w)"
  - "Optimization script is automated yet flexible for manual execution"
  - "Test suite is comprehensive and maintainable (27/27 passing)"
  - "No technical debt introduced; actually addresses debt from Story 1.5"
  - "CONTENT and ANIMATIONS constants provide excellent separation of concerns"
  - "Proper TypeScript usage with 'as const' for compile-time type narrowing"
  - "Accessibility-first approach with descriptive alt text and semantic HTML"
