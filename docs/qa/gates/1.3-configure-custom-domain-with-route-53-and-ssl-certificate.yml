# Gate decision rationale
decision_rationale: |
  This story receives a PASS gate decision based on successful remediation of all previous
  blocking issues and complete deployment verification.

  REMEDIATION SUMMARY (2025-10-07 FAIL → 2025-10-08 PASS):

  1. CRITICAL BLOCKER RESOLVED: Nameservers Updated at Registrar
     - Previous: Domain using GoDaddy nameservers (ns49.domaincontrol.com, ns50.domaincontrol.com)
     - Remediated: Domain now using Route 53 nameservers (ns-18.awsdns-02.com, etc.)
     - Impact: Enabled DNS resolution through AWS, unblocked ACM certificate validation

  2. ACM CERTIFICATE VALIDATED:
     - Previous: Status PENDING_VALIDATION (stuck for 24+ hours)
     - Remediated: Status ISSUED (both bladeandbarrel.com and www.bladeandbarrel.com)
     - Impact: Enabled CloudFront custom domain configuration

  3. CLOUDFRONT CUSTOM DOMAIN CONFIGURED:
     - Previous: Alternate domain names Quantity: 0
     - Remediated: Alternate domain names Quantity: 2 (bladeandbarrel.com, www.bladeandbarrel.com)
     - ACM certificate properly associated
     - Security policy: TLSv1.2_2021 (modern, secure)
     - Impact: CloudFront can serve traffic for custom domains with HTTPS

  4. DNS A RECORDS CREATED:
     - Previous: No A records pointing to CloudFront
     - Remediated: A records (alias) created for both root and www domains
     - Impact: DNS queries resolve to CloudFront distribution

  5. DEPLOYMENT VERIFIED:
     - DNS Resolution: Both domains resolve to CloudFront edge servers (nslookup verified)
     - HTTPS Functionality: Both domains return HTTP/1.1 200 OK via CloudFront (curl verified)
     - SSL Certificate: ACM certificate ISSUED and properly associated
     - HTTP → HTTPS Redirect: Verified operational

  ALL 10 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA VERIFIED COMPLETE:
  ✓ AC 1: Route 53 hosted zone configured
  ✓ AC 2-3: ACM certificate in us-east-1, covers both domains (ISSUED)
  ✓ AC 4-5: CloudFront custom domain and certificate configured
  ✓ AC 6-7: Route 53 A records created (alias)
  ✓ AC 8: DNS propagation verified
  ✓ AC 9: HTTPS enforced
  ✓ AC 10: SSL certificate valid (browser verification documented)

  QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
  - Implementation quality: Excellent (comprehensive automation scripts, robust error handling)
  - Documentation quality: Outstanding (576-line setup guide, updated README and aws-resources.md)
  - Deployment completion: 100% (all ACs verified operational)
  - Security: PASS (HTTPS enforced, modern TLS policy, proper certificate validation)
  - Performance: PASS (CloudFront CDN, Route 53 DNS, compression enabled)
  - Reliability: PASS (infrastructure fully operational, auto-renewal enabled)
  - Maintainability: PASS (excellent documentation and configuration management)

  Quality score: 90/100
  - Implementation: 95/100 (excellent automation and documentation)
  - Deployment: 100/100 (all ACs complete and operational)
  - Minor deductions: Cross-platform compatibility notes (non-blocking, advisory only)

  GATE DECISION: PASS
  Status: Ready for Done

  The story is complete and operational. Infrastructure deployment fully verified.
  Production domains are live and accessible via HTTPS with valid SSL certificates.
