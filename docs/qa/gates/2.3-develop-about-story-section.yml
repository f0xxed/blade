notes: |
  Story 2.3 demonstrates excellent implementation quality following all established patterns
  from previous stories. The component is production-ready with comprehensive test coverage,
  proper accessibility features, and smooth animations. Minor refactoring was performed to
  add color constants for better documentation. No blocking issues identified.
