  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Build failures properly prevent deployment. Missing automated health checks and failure notifications. Non-blocking for initial release."

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive documentation including troubleshooting guide, rollback procedures, and architecture details. Workflow well-structured and clear."
