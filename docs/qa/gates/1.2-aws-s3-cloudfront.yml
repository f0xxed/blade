nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "S3 bucket policy correctly restricts to read-only (s3:GetObject). HTTPS enforced via CloudFront redirect. No public write access. Default CloudFront SSL certificate in use (custom domain planned for Story 1.3)."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Gzip/Brotli compression enabled. Cache TTL appropriately configured (0/86400/31536000). CloudFront edge distribution configured. Bundle size 178.4 KiB total (55.15 kB JS gzipped + 2.50 kB CSS gzipped) well within <200KB target."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "SPA routing properly configured via custom error responses (404/403→index.html). Cache invalidation process documented and scripted. Clear deployment instructions provided."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent documentation in README and aws-resources.md. Reference configuration files for disaster recovery. IAM permissions clearly documented. Deployment process straightforward and repeatable."

notes: |
  This infrastructure story demonstrates excellent execution quality:

  **Strengths:**
  - All 10 acceptance criteria fully met
  - Security best practices followed (read-only S3, HTTPS enforcement)
  - Performance optimized (compression, appropriate caching)
  - Documentation is comprehensive and production-ready
  - Clear deployment process with reference files
  - Bundle size well within performance targets

  **Minor Suggestions (non-blocking):**
  - ErrorCachingMinTTL of 300s is acceptable but could be reduced to 60s for faster development iteration
  - Invalidation script could benefit from error handling for production CI/CD pipelines
  - Deployment checklist in README would provide additional safety for production releases

  **Production Readiness:** ✅ READY

  This story is approved for production deployment. The infrastructure is properly configured,
  secure, performant, and well-documented. All acceptance criteria have been validated and met.
