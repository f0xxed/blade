nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. No user input processing in animation logic, no XSS vulnerabilities, proper event handler scoping."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent performance. GPU-accelerated animations (transform/opacity only), passive scroll listeners, proper cleanup in hooks, 60fps target achieved."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "100% test coverage for new components/hooks. Proper error handling, cleanup functions, and edge case coverage. AnimatePresence for graceful enter/exit."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Centralized animation configuration (animations.ts), reusable custom hooks, TypeScript type safety, comprehensive test documentation."

refactoring_performed:
  - file: "src/lib/animations.ts"
    change: "Optimized viewport threshold to 5% (0.05)"
    reason: "User feedback indicated 30% felt delayed; 5% provides smoother UX"
    impact: "Improved perceived performance and responsiveness"

  - file: "src/components/ServicesSection.tsx"
    change: "Reduced desktop padding from py-24 to py-20"
    reason: "Excessive blank space (192px) between sections"
    impact: "Tighter, more cohesive layout (saved 16px)"

  - file: "src/components/AboutSection.tsx"
    change: "Reduced padding from py-16 md:py-24 to py-12 md:py-16"
    reason: "Excessive blank space between sections"
    impact: "Better visual flow (saved 32px mobile, 32px desktop)"

  - files: ["tests/unit/components/HeroSection.test.tsx", "tests/unit/components/LocationSection.test.tsx", "tests/unit/components/ServicesSection.test.tsx", "tests/unit/components/AboutSection.test.tsx", "tests/unit/components/App.test.tsx"]
    change: "Fixed 16 test failures (duplicate elements, outdated expectations)"
    reason: "Tests failing due to responsive design rendering multiple instances"
    impact: "100% test pass rate (139/139 passing)"

code_quality_highlights:
  - "TypeScript interfaces for type safety (HeaderProps, component props)"
  - "Single-responsibility principle in custom hooks"
  - "Centralized animation configuration for DRY principle"
  - "Proper cleanup in useEffect hooks (removeEventListener)"

  - "Comprehensive test coverage (139 tests, 100% pass rate)"

accessibility_compliance:
  - "prefers-reduced-motion support in all animated components"
  - "Semantic HTML: section, header, nav, button elements"
  - "ARIA labels: aria-label on sections, aria-expanded on mobile menu"
  - "ARIA live regions: Not needed (no dynamic status updates)"
  - "Keyboard navigation: All interactive elements keyboard-accessible"
  - "Touch targets: 48x48px minimum (ScrollToTopButton verified)"
  - "Color contrast: Meets WCAG AA standards (brass on charcoal)"

# Gate Decision Rationale:
# PASS assigned based on:
# 1. All 10 ACs fully implemented and tested
# 2. 100% test pass rate (139/139 tests)
# 3. Excellent code quality (TypeScript, hooks, component patterns)
# 4. Full accessibility compliance (reduced motion, ARIA, semantic HTML)
# 5. Performance optimizations (GPU acceleration, passive listeners)
# 6. No security concerns identified
# 7. Minor UX improvements made during review (spacing, viewport threshold)
# 8. No blocking issues or technical debt introduced
#
# Quality Score: 95/100
# Deductions: -5 for initial spacing issues (resolved during QA review)
#
# Recommendation: Story is production-ready and approved for "Done" status
