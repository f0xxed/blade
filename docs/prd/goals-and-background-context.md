# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Launch a modern one-page website before grand opening to establish digital presence and capture early bookings
- Drive consistent barbershop appointment bookings through integrated online booking system
- Communicate the unique hybrid barbershop-bar concept ("Groomed. Poured. Perfected.") effectively to first-time visitors
- Support pre-launch and ongoing marketing campaigns as the central digital hub
- Establish credibility and search visibility for "barbershop Tampa" and "Channelside bars" searches
- Create a scalable digital foundation to support future multi-location expansion

## Background Context

Blade and Barrel is launching as an innovative hybrid establishment in Tampa's Channelside district, seamlessly blending premium barbershop services with a vibrant community bar. The business transforms from a daytime grooming destination (offering haircuts, beard trims, and complimentary draft beer) into an evening neighborhood bar, creating a unique "third place" for professional men aged 25-50.

Currently, the business lacks any digital presence to support its imminent grand opening (1-2 months away). Without a website, Blade and Barrel faces critical challenges: lost booking revenue (60-70% of modern consumers prefer online scheduling), poor discoverability in local searches, brand confusion around the hybrid concept, and competitive disadvantage against established Tampa barbershops with professional websites. The website will serve as the digital embodiment of the brand's dual identity, driving bookings, building community engagement, and establishing the foundation for future franchise expansion inspired by the Scissors and Scotch model.
