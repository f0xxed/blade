# Checklist Results Report

## Executive Summary

**Overall PRD Completeness:** 92%

**MVP Scope Appropriateness:** Just Right - The 3-epic structure delivers incremental value with appropriate scope for a 1-2 month timeline.

**Readiness for Architecture Phase:** **READY** - PRD is comprehensive with clear technical constraints, functional requirements, and well-structured epics. Minor enhancements recommended but not blocking.

**Most Critical Gaps:**
1. No explicit MVP validation approach defined (how will we test success?)
2. Data requirements section minimal (acceptable for static site, but should be noted)
3. Missing explicit user journey documentation (flows are implied but not diagrammed)

## Top Issues by Priority

### BLOCKERS
**None** - PRD is ready for architecture phase.

### HIGH Priority
1. **Missing MVP Validation Approach** (Section 2.3)
   - How will we measure MVP success post-launch?
   - What user feedback mechanisms will we implement?
   - Criteria for moving beyond MVP unclear
   - **Recommendation:** Add story for post-launch analytics review and user feedback collection

2. **User Journey Documentation** (Section 3.1)
   - Primary user flows implied but not explicitly documented
   - Booking flow: Discover → Learn → Book not diagrammed
   - Inquiry flow: Browse → Question → Contact not mapped
   - **Recommendation:** Acceptable to defer to UX Expert phase, but could enhance clarity

### MEDIUM Priority
3. **Data Requirements Light** (Section 8.1)
   - Minimal data storage for static site, but should explicitly note "no database required"
   - Instagram feed data caching strategy not specified
   - Contact form data retention policy not mentioned (SES handles, but should note)
   - **Recommendation:** Add note in Technical Assumptions that no persistent database is required for MVP

4. **Operational Requirements** (Section 8.3)
   - Deployment frequency not specified (assumed: on-demand via CI/CD)
   - Support requirements not documented (who handles site issues post-launch?)
   - **Recommendation:** Add operational ownership to Story 3.14 or post-launch documentation

### LOW Priority
5. **Stakeholder Alignment** (Section 9.2)
   - Key stakeholders identified (Rich Keeley, business owner) but no formal approval process
   - **Recommendation:** Story 3.13 includes business owner sign-off, sufficient for small business

## MVP Scope Assessment

### ✅ **Scope is Appropriately Minimal**

**Well-Scoped Features:**
- One-page website format minimizes complexity
- Third-party booking integration (vs. custom booking system)
- Serverless contact form (Lambda + SES, no backend server)
- Static site hosting (S3/CloudFront, no database)
- Deferred features properly identified (e-commerce, team profiles, blog, event calendar)

**Features That Could Be Cut (If Timeline Pressure Increases):**
- Story 2.5: Instagram feed integration (nice-to-have social proof, not critical for bookings)
- Story 3.6: reCAPTCHA spam protection (could launch with honeypot method instead)
- Story 2.7: Scroll animations (visual polish, not functional requirement)

**No Missing Essential Features** - All core user needs addressed:
- ✅ Information discovery (hero, services, about)
- ✅ Booking capability (Epic 3, Story 3.2)
- ✅ Contact/inquiry (Epic 3, Stories 3.3-3.6)
- ✅ Location/hours (Epic 2, Story 2.4)

**Complexity Concerns:**
- **AWS Infrastructure Setup** (Epic 1, Stories 1.2-1.4): Moderate complexity for developer unfamiliar with AWS
  - Mitigation: Well-documented ACs, CloudFront SPA routing explicitly called out
- **Booking Platform Integration** (Story 3.1-3.2): Dependency on third-party API/embed capabilities
  - Mitigation: Story 3.1 includes research phase to validate integration feasibility

**Timeline Realism:**
- 27 stories across 3 epics for 1-2 month timeline
- Average story size: 2-4 hours = 54-108 developer hours
- **Assessment:** Aggressive but achievable with focused execution
- **Risk Mitigation:** Epic 1 delivers "coming soon" page quickly, allowing phased rollout if needed

## Technical Readiness

### ✅ **Clear Technical Constraints**
- React + Vite + shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS specified
- AWS S3 + CloudFront + Lambda + SES architecture documented
- No AWS Amplify (manual setup preferred)
- Performance targets specific: <2s load, Lighthouse 85+, WCAG AA
- Browser support explicit: Last 2 versions Chrome/Safari/Firefox/Edge

### 🔍 **Identified Technical Risks**
1. **CloudFront SPA Routing** (Story 1.2, AC #4)
   - Risk: Incorrect CloudFront configuration breaks client-side routing
   - Mitigation: Specific AC addresses this, architect should document detailed CloudFront settings

2. **Booking Platform Unknown** (Story 3.1)
   - Risk: Selected platform may have poor API/embed capabilities
   - Mitigation: Story 3.1 research phase validates integration before development

3. **Instagram API Rate Limits** (Story 2.5, AC #10)
   - Risk: API calls exceed limits, feed breaks
   - Mitigation: AC includes caching requirement, architect should specify cache duration

4. **SES Sandbox Mode** (Story 3.5, AC #1)
   - Risk: SES in sandbox only sends to verified emails, limiting testing
   - Mitigation: AC explicitly calls out sandbox exit requirement for production

### 🏗️ **Areas Needing Architect Investigation**
1. **CloudFront Configuration Details**
   - Error page routing for SPA (404 → index.html with 200 status)
   - Cache invalidation strategy (full invalidation vs. versioned assets)
   - Cache-Control headers for static assets vs. index.html

2. **Instagram Feed Implementation**
   - Client-side API call vs. serverless function proxy (to hide access token)
   - Cache duration to balance freshness vs. API limits
   - Fallback content if Instagram API unavailable

3. **Environment Variable Management**
   - How to inject environment variables into static React build
   - API keys for Instagram, Google Maps, reCAPTCHA, GA4
   - Strategy: Build-time injection vs. runtime config

4. **CI/CD Pipeline Details**
   - GitHub Actions workflow specifics (AWS credential management, cache invalidation)
   - Build optimization (caching node_modules, incremental builds)
   - Deployment rollback strategy if production issues occur

## Recommendations

### **Immediate Actions (Before Architect Phase)**

**✅ PROCEED AS-IS** - PRD is comprehensive and ready for architecture. High priority items are enhancements, not blockers. Architect can address technical details during design phase.

## Final Decision

**✅ READY FOR ARCHITECT**

The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design. The document provides:

- Clear problem definition and business goals from project brief
- Well-defined MVP scope with appropriate feature prioritization
- Comprehensive functional and non-functional requirements
- Detailed 3-epic structure with 27 properly sequenced stories
- Clear technical constraints and technology stack guidance
- Specific acceptance criteria for all stories

**Identified gaps are enhancements, not blockers.** The Architect can proceed with confidence to design the technical architecture, component structure, and implementation details.
