# Story 1.4: Implement CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

## Status

**Done**

---

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** automated build and deployment on every push to main branch,
**so that** changes go live quickly without manual deployment steps.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. GitHub repository created and local project pushed to remote
2. GitHub Actions workflow file created (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
3. Workflow triggers on push to `main` branch
4. Workflow installs dependencies (`npm install`) and runs build (`npm run build`)
5. AWS credentials securely stored in GitHub Secrets (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)
6. Workflow syncs `/dist` directory to S3 bucket using AWS CLI or GitHub Actions S3 sync
7. Workflow invalidates CloudFront cache after deployment to ensure fresh content (`aws cloudfront create-invalidation`)
8. Build failures prevent deployment - workflow fails if build step errors
9. Deployment status visible in GitHub Actions tab with success/failure indicators
10. Test deployment: Push commit to `main` and verify automated deployment completes successfully and site updates

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

[Source: Story 1.3 Dev Agent Record]

Story 1.3 successfully configured custom domain infrastructure with the following production resources ready for CI/CD integration:

- **CloudFront Distribution ID**: `EJNJPQN7X1JDD`
- **Custom Domain**: `https://bladeandbarrel.com` (primary production URL)
- **S3 Bucket**: `bladeandbarrel-site` (us-east-1)
- **SSL Certificate**: ACM certificate validated and associated with CloudFront
- **Infrastructure Directory**: `/infrastructure` directory with reference configuration files
- **Current Deployment Method**: Manual AWS CLI commands (to be replaced with automated CI/CD)

The infrastructure is fully operational and ready to accept automated deployments via GitHub Actions. This story will replace manual deployment steps with a fully automated CI/CD pipeline.

### CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#CI/CD Pipeline]

**CI/CD Platform:**
- **Platform**: GitHub Actions
- **Cost**: Free for public repositories
- **Workflow Location**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Trigger**: Push to `main` branch or manual `workflow_dispatch`

**Workflow Structure:**

The complete workflow YAML is provided in the architecture document. Key components:

1. **Frontend Deployment Job** (`deploy-frontend`):
   - Runs on `ubuntu-latest`
   - Checks out code
   - Sets up Node.js 20 with npm cache
   - Installs dependencies: `npm ci`
   - Builds frontend: `npm run build`
   - Configures AWS credentials from GitHub Secrets
   - Syncs dist/ to S3 with optimized cache headers
   - Invalidates CloudFront cache for fresh content delivery

2. **Lambda Deployment Job** (`deploy-lambda`, future):
   - Deferred to Epic 2 when backend Lambda functions are implemented
   - Will deploy contact-form and instagram-proxy Lambda functions
   - Current story focuses on frontend deployment only

**Environment Variables in Build:**

Frontend build requires environment variables injected at build time:
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL`: Backend API endpoint (future)
- `VITE_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID`: Google Analytics 4 tracking ID (future)
- `VITE_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY`: reCAPTCHA site key (future)
- `VITE_INSTAGRAM_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID`: Instagram Business Account ID (future)

These are configured as GitHub Secrets and passed to build step via `env:` block.

### AWS Credentials and Permissions

[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#Deployment Strategy]

**Required AWS IAM Permissions:**

The GitHub Actions workflow requires an AWS IAM user with the following permissions:

1. **S3 Permissions** (for static site deployment):
   - `s3:PutObject` - Upload files to S3 bucket
   - `s3:DeleteObject` - Remove old files during sync
   - `s3:ListBucket` - List bucket contents for sync

2. **CloudFront Permissions** (for cache invalidation):
   - `cloudfront:CreateInvalidation` - Invalidate cached content
   - `cloudfront:GetInvalidation` - Check invalidation status

**IAM User Setup:**
- Create dedicated IAM user for GitHub Actions (e.g., `github-actions-deploy`)
- Attach custom policy with minimal required permissions
- Generate access key ID and secret access key
- Store credentials in GitHub Secrets (never commit to repository)

### S3 Sync and Cache Optimization

[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#CI/CD Pipeline]

**S3 Sync Strategy:**

Two-step sync process for optimal caching:

1. **Sync all assets with long-term caching:**
   ```bash
   aws s3 sync dist/ s3://$S3_BUCKET --delete \
     --cache-control "public, max-age=31536000, immutable" \
     --exclude "index.html"
   ```
   - `--delete` removes old files from S3 (clean deployments)
   - `max-age=31536000` = 1 year cache for hashed assets (Vite generates unique filenames)
   - `immutable` tells browsers asset will never change
   - `--exclude "index.html"` prevents index.html from getting cached

2. **Upload index.html with no caching:**
   ```bash
   aws s3 cp dist/index.html s3://$S3_BUCKET/index.html \
     --cache-control "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"
   ```
   - Ensures browsers always fetch latest index.html
   - Index.html references hashed assets, so new builds get new filenames

**Why This Matters:**
- Users get instant updates when index.html changes
- Hashed assets (JS/CSS) cached for 1 year = faster page loads
- CloudFront edge caching amplifies performance globally

### CloudFront Cache Invalidation

[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#CI/CD Pipeline]

**Invalidation Strategy:**

After S3 sync completes, invalidate CloudFront cache:

```bash
aws cloudfront create-invalidation \
  --distribution-id $CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID \
  --paths "/*"
```

**Invalidation Details:**
- `--paths "/*"` invalidates all cached content at CloudFront edge locations
- Invalidation takes **1-5 minutes** to propagate to all edge locations
- **First 1,000 invalidations per month are FREE**
- Additional invalidations: $0.005 per path (negligible cost)

**Why Invalidation is Required:**
- CloudFront caches content at edge locations globally
- Without invalidation, users may see stale content for hours/days
- Invalidation forces CloudFront to fetch fresh content from S3 origin

### GitHub Actions Workflow Configuration

[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#CI/CD Pipeline]

**Workflow Triggers:**

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:
```

- **Push to main**: Automatic deployment on every commit to main branch
- **workflow_dispatch**: Manual trigger via GitHub UI (useful for hotfixes or rollbacks)

**Node.js Setup:**

```yaml
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '20'
    cache: 'npm'
```

- Uses Node.js 20.x LTS (matches tech stack requirement)
- `cache: 'npm'` caches node_modules for faster builds (30+ seconds saved per run)

**AWS Credentials Configuration:**

```yaml
- name: Configure AWS credentials
  uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
  with:
    aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
    aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
    aws-region: us-east-1
```

- Configures AWS CLI with credentials from GitHub Secrets
- Region set to `us-east-1` (matches S3 bucket and CloudFront distribution)

### Project Structure

[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

**CI/CD File Locations:**

```
blade/ (root)
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       ├── ci.yml                    # Run tests and linting (future)
│       └── deploy.yml                # Build and deploy to AWS (this story)
```

**New Files to Create:**
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Main CI/CD workflow file

**Files to Update:**
- `README.md` - Add deployment section and workflow status badge
- `docs/deployment-guide.md` - Create or update with detailed deployment instructions
- `infrastructure/aws-resources.md` - Add IAM user permissions documentation

### GitHub Secrets Configuration

**Required Secrets (to be added in GitHub repository settings):**

**AWS Credentials:**
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - IAM user access key ID
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - IAM user secret access key

**AWS Infrastructure IDs:**
- `S3_BUCKET` - S3 bucket name (value: `bladeandbarrel-site`)
- `CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID` - CloudFront distribution ID (value: `EJNJPQN7X1JDD`)

**Frontend Environment Variables (placeholders for future stories):**
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` - Backend API endpoint (placeholder: `https://api.bladeandbarrel.com`)
- `VITE_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID` - Google Analytics 4 measurement ID (empty until Epic 3)
- `VITE_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` - reCAPTCHA site key (empty until Epic 2)
- `VITE_INSTAGRAM_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID` - Instagram Business Account ID (empty until Epic 3)

**Security Note:**
- Never commit secrets to repository (use GitHub Secrets)
- IAM user should have minimal required permissions (principle of least privilege)
- Rotate AWS access keys periodically for security

### Build Failure Handling

[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#Deployment Process]

**Build Failure Prevention:**

GitHub Actions automatically fails workflow if any step returns non-zero exit code:

1. **TypeScript compilation errors** → `npm run build` fails → workflow stops
2. **Missing dependencies** → `npm ci` fails → workflow stops
3. **AWS CLI errors** → S3 sync or CloudFront invalidation fails → workflow stops

**Deployment Safety:**
- If build fails, S3 sync step never runs (previous deployment remains live)
- If S3 sync fails, CloudFront invalidation never runs (no partial deployment)
- GitHub Actions tab shows clear error logs for debugging

**Rollback Strategy:**

If bad deployment goes live:
1. **Option 1 (Quick)**: Revert commit and push to main (triggers new deployment)
2. **Option 2 (Manual)**: Use S3 versioning to restore previous deployment
3. **Option 3 (Immediate)**: Manually invalidate CloudFront and sync old files to S3

### File Locations

**New Files to Create:**
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment

**Files to Modify:**
- `README.md` - Add deployment section with workflow status badge and setup instructions
- `docs/deployment-guide.md` - Create comprehensive deployment guide (or update if exists)
- `infrastructure/aws-resources.md` - Document IAM user permissions required for CI/CD

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Infrastructure Testing (Workflow Validation):**

No automated tests required for CI/CD setup. Manual verification steps:

1. **Workflow Syntax Validation**:
   - GitHub Actions automatically validates YAML syntax on push
   - Workflow must pass syntax validation before execution

2. **Build Success Verification**:
   - Verify `npm run build` completes successfully
   - Verify no TypeScript compilation errors
   - Verify dist/ directory created with expected files

3. **Deployment Success Verification**:
   - Verify S3 sync completes (check S3 bucket contents in AWS console)
   - Verify CloudFront invalidation created (check CloudFront invalidations tab)
   - Verify changes visible at https://bladeandbarrel.com after invalidation completes

4. **Build Failure Test**:
   - Intentionally introduce TypeScript error
   - Push to main and verify workflow fails
   - Verify deployment does NOT occur (S3 unchanged)
   - Fix error and verify next deployment succeeds

**Future Test Integration (Epic 2+):**
- CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) will run tests before allowing merge
- Deployment workflow will only run if tests pass
- Integration tests will verify deployed site is functional

### Technical Constraints

**GitHub Actions Limitations:**
- Free tier: 2,000 minutes/month for private repos (public repos = unlimited)
- Workflow run timeout: 6 hours maximum (typical deployment: 2-5 minutes)
- Secrets stored encrypted at rest (secure storage)

**CloudFront Invalidation Constraints:**
- Invalidation propagation time: **1-5 minutes** (not instant)
- Free tier: **1,000 invalidations per month** (more than sufficient for typical usage)
- Invalidation limits: Max 3,000 paths per invalidation request

**S3 Sync Timing:**
- Small deployments (< 10 MB): **10-30 seconds**
- Typical deployment with assets: **30-60 seconds**
- Upload speed depends on file count and size

**Deployment Timing Breakdown:**
- Checkout + Node.js setup: ~20 seconds
- npm ci (with cache): ~30 seconds
- npm run build: ~20-40 seconds
- S3 sync: ~30-60 seconds
- CloudFront invalidation: ~1-5 minutes (async, doesn't block workflow)
- **Total workflow execution**: ~2-3 minutes
- **Time until changes live**: ~3-8 minutes (including invalidation)

### Cost Considerations

**GitHub Actions:**
- **Public repositories**: FREE unlimited build minutes
- **Private repositories**: FREE 2,000 minutes/month (sufficient for most projects)

**AWS CloudFront Invalidations:**
- **First 1,000 invalidations/month**: FREE
- **Additional invalidations**: $0.005 per path (negligible)
- **Estimated monthly cost**: $0 (well within free tier)

**Total CI/CD Cost Impact**: **$0/month** (assuming public repo or within private repo free tier)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Implementation Quality: EXCELLENT**

Story 1.4 demonstrates exceptional implementation quality with comprehensive CI/CD automation, well-structured documentation, and proper security practices. The GitHub Actions workflow follows industry best practices with optimized caching strategies, proper secret management, and fail-safe deployment patterns.

**Strengths:**
- Production-grade GitHub Actions workflow with latest action versions (@v4)
- Excellent two-tier cache strategy (1-year for assets, no-cache for index.html)
- Minimal IAM permissions following principle of least privilege
- Comprehensive documentation including troubleshooting and rollback procedures
- End-to-end deployment successfully tested and verified
- Proper use of `npm ci` for deterministic builds in CI environment

**Architecture Highlights:**
- Sequential workflow steps with proper error handling

- Build failures properly prevent deployment (native GitHub Actions behavior)

### Refactoring Performed

#### 1. **File**: `docs/deployment-guide.md`
- **Change**: Removed exposed AWS access key ID from plaintext documentation (line 92)
- **Why**: CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE - AWS credentials exposed in version control pose severe security risk. Access keys in plaintext allow unauthorized AWS account access.
- **How**: Replaced actual access key value with `(stored in GitHub Secrets)` placeholder. Credentials should only exist in encrypted GitHub Secrets, never in documentation or code.
- **Impact**: Eliminated critical security vulnerability before production use

#### 2. **File**: `.gitignore`
- **Change**: Added AWS credential file patterns and additional secret exclusions
- **Why**: Prevent accidental commit of AWS credentials, SSH keys, and sensitive configuration files
- **How**: Added comprehensive patterns:
  - `.aws/` directory (AWS CLI credentials)
  - `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.ppk` (SSH and private keys)
  - `credentials.json`, `secrets.json` (common secret file names)
  - `config.local.*` (local configuration overrides)
- **Impact**: Strengthened repository security posture and prevented potential future credential leaks

- **Then**: Cache invalidated at all edge locations with paths "/*"
- **Evidence**: deploy.yml:52-56 shows proper invalidation command
- **Status**: ✓ VALIDATED

**AC 8: Build failures prevent deployment**
- **Given**: TypeScript error or build failure occurs
- **When**: Build step executes
- **Then**: Workflow fails at build step, S3 sync never runs, previous deployment remains live

### Security Review

**Critical Issues (Remediated):**
1. ✓ **FIXED**: AWS access key ID exposed in deployment-guide.md (removed during review)

**Security Strengths:**
- ✓ GitHub Secrets used for all sensitive values (encrypted at rest)
- ✓ IAM policy follows principle of least privilege (only S3 + CloudFront permissions)
- ✓ Resource-scoped IAM policy (specific bucket and distribution ARNs)
- ✓ No hardcoded credentials in workflow file
- ✓ HTTPS enforced via CloudFront with ACM certificate
- ✓ .gitignore properly excludes .env files and now AWS credentials

**Remaining Security Concerns:**
- ⚠️ **MEDIUM**: No documented AWS access key rotation schedule (recommend 90-day rotation)
- ⚠️ **LOW**: IAM policy could specify conditions (e.g., require MFA for console access)

**Security Recommendations:**
1. Implement and document 90-day access key rotation procedure
2. Consider AWS IAM Identity Center for long-term credential management
3. Add CloudWatch alerting for unusual S3/CloudFront API activity
4. Document incident response procedure for credential compromise

### Performance Considerations

**Performance Strengths:**
- ✓ **EXCELLENT**: Two-tier caching strategy optimizes both speed and freshness
  - Assets (JS/CSS): `max-age=31536000, immutable` (1-year cache)
  - index.html: `no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate` (always fresh)
- ✓ CloudFront edge caching provides global low-latency delivery
- ✓ npm caching in workflow reduces build time by ~30 seconds
- ✓ Workflow execution time: ~45-50 seconds (excellent)
- ✓ Time to live (push to deployment): ~3 minutes

**Performance Validation:**
- Cache headers verified via browser DevTools (documented in Dev Agent Record)
- CloudFront distribution healthy with global edge locations
- Build performance optimized with dependency caching

**No Performance Issues Identified**

### Files Modified During Review

**Security Remediation:**
1. `docs/deployment-guide.md` - Removed exposed AWS access key ID (line 92)
2. `.gitignore` - Added AWS credential file patterns (lines 31-38)

**Change Impact:**
- Zero functional changes to deployment workflow
- Only security hardening and documentation fixes
- No regression risk

**Action Required:**
- Dev team should update File List in story to include these QA modifications
- Recommend immediate credential rotation as precautionary measure

### Gate Status

**Quality Gate**: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/1.4-ci-cd-pipeline.yml

**Gate Decision Rationale:**
- Original critical security issue (exposed credentials) remediated during review
- All 10 acceptance criteria fully validated with complete traceability
- Excellent implementation quality with production-ready workflow
- Remaining concerns are non-blocking: missing rotation schedule and health checks
- NFR Security: CONCERNS (no rotation schedule documented)
- NFR Reliability: CONCERNS (no automated health checks post-deployment)

**Risk Profile**: docs/qa/assessments/1.4-risk-20251008.md (not created - low risk story)

**Top Issues Summary:**
1. **MEDIUM** (SEC-002): No documented AWS access key rotation schedule
2. **LOW** (RELIABILITY-001): No automated deployment health check
3. **LOW** (OPS-001): No deployment failure notifications

### Recommended Status

**✓ Ready for Done** with Advisory Recommendations

**Justification:**
- All acceptance criteria met and validated
- Critical security vulnerability remediated during review
- Production deployment successful and verified
- Remaining concerns are advisory improvements, not blockers
- Code quality is exceptional with comprehensive documentation

**Advisory Recommendations for Future Stories:**
1. Add AWS access key rotation procedure (Story 1.5 or operational runbook)
2. Implement deployment health checks (Epic 2 - monitoring story)
3. Add deployment notifications (Epic 2 - observability story)

**Story Owner Decision:**
The story is technically complete and ready for "Done" status. The team should decide whether to address advisory recommendations immediately or defer to future stories based on risk tolerance and sprint capacity.
