## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

[Source: Story 2.2 Dev Agent Record]

Story 2.2 successfully established component patterns that Story 2.3 will follow:

- **Component Structure**: TypeScript interfaces, named exports, functional components
- **Framer Motion Animations**: Scroll-triggered animations using `motion.section` with `initial`/`whileInView` props
- **Accessibility**: `useReducedMotion()` hook to respect user preferences
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind breakpoint classes (sm, md, lg) for mobile-first responsive layouts
- **Testing Patterns**: React Testing Library with Vitest for component tests

**Key Patterns to Reuse**:
```typescript
// Component structure from previous sections
import { motion, useReducedMotion } from 'framer-motion';

export function AboutSection() {
  const shouldReduceMotion = useReducedMotion();

  return (
    <motion.section
      initial={shouldReduceMotion ? {} : { opacity: 0, y: 30 }}
      whileInView={shouldReduceMotion ? {} : { opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
      viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.3 }}
      transition={{ duration: 0.6 }}
      className="py-16 md:py-24"
    >
      {/* Content */}
    </motion.section>
  );
}
```

---

### Component Architecture

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Component Organization]

**Component File Location**: `/src/components/AboutSection.tsx`

**Component Structure Pattern**:
```typescript
// AboutSection.tsx
import { motion, useReducedMotion } from 'framer-motion';

interface AboutSectionProps {
  // Optional props for customization if needed
  className?: string;
}

export function AboutSection({ className }: AboutSectionProps = {}) {
  const shouldReduceMotion = useReducedMotion();

  return (
    <motion.section
      initial={shouldReduceMotion ? {} : { opacity: 0, y: 30 }}
      whileInView={shouldReduceMotion ? {} : { opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
      viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.3 }}
      transition={{ duration: 0.6 }}
      className={`py-16 md:py-24 px-4 md:px-8 ${className || ''}`}
      aria-label="About Blade and Barrel"
    >
      <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto">
        {/* Two-column grid layout */}
        <div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-12 items-center">
          {/* Text content (left on desktop, top on mobile) */}
          <motion.div
            initial={shouldReduceMotion ? {} : { opacity: 0, x: -30 }}
            whileInView={shouldReduceMotion ? {} : { opacity: 1, x: 0 }}
            viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.3 }}
            transition={{ duration: 0.6, delay: 0.2 }}
          >
            <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold mb-6">Our Story</h2>
            {/* Story paragraphs */}
            <div className="space-y-4 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
              <p>{/* Paragraph 1: Hybrid concept intro */}</p>
              <p>{/* Paragraph 2: Day-to-night transformation */}</p>
              <p>{/* Paragraph 3: Vision and expansion */}</p>
            </div>
          </motion.div>

          {/* Image content (right on desktop, bottom on mobile) */}
          <motion.div
            initial={shouldReduceMotion ? {} : { opacity: 0, x: 30 }}
            whileInView={shouldReduceMotion ? {} : { opacity: 1, x: 0 }}
            viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.3 }}
            transition={{ duration: 0.6, delay: 0.4 }}
            className="relative"
          >
            <picture>
              <source srcSet="/images/interior.webp" type="image/webp" />
              <img
                src="/images/interior.jpg"
                alt="Blade and Barrel interior showcasing barbershop and bar atmosphere"
                className="rounded-lg shadow-lg w-full h-auto"
                loading="lazy"
              />
            </picture>
          </motion.div>
        </div>

        {/* Founder bio section (optional, can be integrated or separate) */}
        <div className="mt-12 p-6 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg">
          {/* Rich Keeley bio content */}
        </div>
      </div>
    </motion.section>
  );
}
```

**Key Patterns**:
- Use TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Export as named export (not default)
- Use Framer Motion for scroll-triggered animations with separate text/image animations
- Responsive design with Tailwind mobile-first approach (grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2)
- Semantic HTML (`<section>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`) with ARIA labels

---

### Tech Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Core Technologies for This Story**:
- **React 18.2+**: Functional component with TypeScript
- **TypeScript 5.3+**: Type-safe interfaces for component props
- **Tailwind CSS 3.4+**: Grid layout, responsive utilities, typography
- **Framer Motion 11.0+**: Scroll-triggered animations (`whileInView`, `viewport`)
- **Vitest 1.0+**: Unit testing framework
- **React Testing Library 14.0+**: Component testing

**Responsive Breakpoints** (Tailwind defaults):
- Mobile: `< 640px` (sm breakpoint)
- Tablet: `640px - 1024px` (md to lg breakpoints)
- Desktop: `> 1024px` (lg+ breakpoints)

**Animation Patterns**:
- Scroll-triggered animations using `whileInView` with `viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.3 }}`
- Separate animations for text (fade-in-left) and image (fade-in-right) with staggered delays
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` using `useReducedMotion()` hook

**Image Optimization**:
- Use `<picture>` element with WebP optimization
- Lazy load images with `loading="lazy"` attribute
- Provide descriptive alt text for accessibility

---

### Content Requirements

[Source: docs/prd/goals-and-background-context.md, docs/front-end-spec.md#Layout 3: About Section]

**Brand Story Content**:
- **Hybrid Concept**: Blade and Barrel is a unique hybrid establishment blending premium barbershop services with a vibrant community bar
- **Day-to-Night Transformation**: Daytime grooming destination (haircuts, beard trims, complimentary draft beer) → evening neighborhood bar
- **Target Audience**: Professional men aged 25-50, creating a "third place" in Tampa's Channelside district
- **Location**: Tampa's Channelside district, emphasizing community focus and local engagement
- **Vision**: Inspired by Scissors and Scotch model, with aspirations for future multi-location expansion

**Founder Bio Content** (Placeholder - needs actual content):
- **Name**: Rich Keeley
- **Role**: Founder
- **Background**: Entrepreneurial journey (details to be provided)
- **Vision**: Creating an authentic, modern barbershop-bar experience that merges craftsmanship with community

**Content Tone & Style**:
- **Authentic**: Real, honest, no pretense
- **Bold**: Strong statements, confident voice
- **Refined**: Attention to detail, quality-focused
- **Social**: Community-focused, welcoming, "third place" atmosphere

**Supporting Images**:
- Use interior shots from `/public/images/Barbearia industrial.jpg` or `/public/images/barber-interior-02.jpg`
- Images should showcase the space, atmosphere, or concept photography
- Ensure images are optimized (WebP with JPG fallback, compressed to ~300KB desktop)

### Styling Guidelines

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md, docs/front-end-spec.md#Branding & Style Guide]

**Tailwind CSS Classes for AboutSection**:

**Section Container**:
- `py-16 md:py-24`: Vertical padding (80px desktop, 48px mobile)
- `px-4 md:px-8`: Horizontal padding
- `max-w-7xl mx-auto`: Max width with centered layout

**Grid Layout**:
- `grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-12`: Two-column desktop, single-column mobile
- `items-center`: Vertically center align text and image

**Section Heading**:
- `text-3xl md:text-4xl`: Responsive font sizing (32px mobile, 48px desktop)
- `font-bold`: Bold weight
- `mb-6`: Margin bottom for spacing

**Body Text**:
- `space-y-4`: Consistent spacing between paragraphs
- `text-base md:text-lg`: Responsive body text (16px mobile, 18px desktop)
- `leading-relaxed`: Line height 1.6 for readability

**Image Styling**:
- `rounded-lg`: Rounded corners
- `shadow-lg`: Drop shadow for elevation
- `w-full h-auto`: Responsive sizing

**Founder Bio Section**:
- `mt-12`: Top margin for separation
- `p-6`: Internal padding
- `bg-gray-50`: Subtle background color
- `rounded-lg`: Rounded corners

**Color Palette** (from front-end spec):
- **Background Light**: `#E8DCC8` (Cream/bone) - Primary light section backgrounds
- **Primary Text**: `#1A1A1A` (Deep charcoal/black) - Primary text color
- **Accent**: `#B8935E` (Brass/gold) - Accent elements, decorative details
- **Neutral Mid**: `#8B6F47` (Warm wood/tan) - Supporting text, borders

### Framer Motion Animation Patterns

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, Story 2.2 implementation]

**Scroll-Triggered Section Animation**:
```typescript
<motion.section
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 30 }}
  whileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.3 }}  // Trigger when 30% visible
  transition={{ duration: 0.6, ease: 'easeOut' }}
  className="py-16..."
  aria-label="About Blade and Barrel"
>
```

**Staggered Text and Image Animations**:
```typescript
// Text content (fade-in-left)
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, x: -30 }}
  whileInView={{ opacity: 1, x: 0 }}
  viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.3 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.6, delay: 0.2 }}
>
  {/* Text content */}
</motion.div>

// Image content (fade-in-right)
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, x: 30 }}
  whileInView={{ opacity: 1, x: 0 }}
  viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.3 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.6, delay: 0.4 }}
>
  {/* Image content */}
</motion.div>
```

**Accessibility - Respect prefers-reduced-motion**:
```typescript
import { useReducedMotion } from 'framer-motion';

export function AboutSection() {
  const shouldReduceMotion = useReducedMotion();

  const animationProps = shouldReduceMotion
    ? {}  // No animation
    : {
        initial: { opacity: 0, y: 30 },
        whileInView: { opacity: 1, y: 0 }
      };

  return <motion.section {...animationProps}>...</motion.section>;
}
```

**Animation Best Practices**:
- Use `whileInView` for scroll-triggered animations
- Set `viewport={{ once: true }}` to animate only on first scroll (performance)
- Set `viewport={{ amount: 0.3 }}` to trigger when 30% of element is visible
- Use GPU-accelerated properties: `opacity`, `x`, `y` (transform)
- Duration: 600ms for section reveals (responsive feel)
- Stagger delays: 200ms between text and image animations

---

### Accessibility Requirements

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md, docs/front-end-spec.md#Accessibility Requirements]

**Semantic HTML**:
- Use `<section>` element for semantic sectioning
- Use `<h2>` for section heading ("Our Story" follows h1 in HeroSection)
- Use `<h3>` for founder bio heading if applicable
- Use `<p>` for paragraph content

**ARIA Labels**:
- Add `aria-label="About Blade and Barrel"` to section element
- Ensure images have descriptive `alt` text

**Text Contrast**:
- Ensure all text meets WCAG AA contrast ratio (4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for large text)
- Test color combinations: charcoal text on cream background
- Body text (#1A1A1A) on cream background (#E8DCC8) provides sufficient contrast

**Motion Accessibility**:
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` user preference
- Use Framer Motion's `useReducedMotion()` hook
- Conditionally disable animations for users who prefer less motion

**Keyboard Navigation**:
- Content is non-interactive (no click handlers in this story)
- Ensure focus indicators are visible if any interactive elements are added later

**Image Accessibility**:
- Use descriptive alt text: "Blade and Barrel interior showcasing barbershop and bar atmosphere"
- Provide context in alt text, not just generic descriptions

---

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Testing Framework**:
- **Vitest 1.0+**: Jest-compatible testing (native Vite integration)
- **React Testing Library 14.0+**: User-centric component testing

**Test File**: `/tests/unit/components/AboutSection.test.tsx`

**Required Tests**:
1. **Rendering Tests**:
   - Component renders with correct section heading ("Our Story")
   - Component renders story content paragraphs
   - Component renders founder bio section
   - Component renders supporting images with proper alt text

2. **Layout Tests**:
   - Grid has responsive classes (grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2)
   - Section has appropriate padding and spacing classes
   - Text and image stack vertically on mobile, side-by-side on desktop

3. **Accessibility Tests**:
   - Section has semantic HTML structure (`<section>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`)
   - Section has ARIA label (`aria-label="About Blade and Barrel"`)
   - Images have descriptive alt text

4. **Content Tests**:
   - Story content includes hybrid barbershop-bar concept
   - Content mentions Channelside Tampa location
   - Founder bio is present (if applicable)

**Example Test**:
```typescript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { AboutSection } from '@/components/AboutSection';

describe('AboutSection Component', () => {
  it('renders section heading', () => {
    render(<AboutSection />);
    expect(screen.getByRole('heading', { name: /our story/i, level: 2 })).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('renders story content paragraphs', () => {
    render(<AboutSection />);
    expect(screen.getByText(/hybrid/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText(/channelside/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('renders supporting image with alt text', () => {
    render(<AboutSection />);
    const image = screen.getByAlt(/blade and barrel interior/i);
    expect(image).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(image).toHaveAttribute('loading', 'lazy');
  });

  it('has responsive grid layout classes', () => {
    const { container } = render(<AboutSection />);
    const grid = container.querySelector('.grid');
    expect(grid?.className).toContain('grid-cols-1');
    expect(grid?.className).toContain('lg:grid-cols-2');
  });

  it('has proper ARIA label for accessibility', () => {
    const { container } = render(<AboutSection />);
    const section = container.querySelector('section');
    expect(section).toHaveAttribute('aria-label', 'About Blade and Barrel');
  });
});
```

**Running Tests**:
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

**Test Coverage Target**: Maintain 80%+ coverage for component tests

### Integration with App.tsx

[Source: Story 2.2 implementation]

**Current App.tsx Structure** (after Story 2.2):
```typescript
import { HeroSection } from '@/components/HeroSection';
import { ServicesSection } from '@/components/ServicesSection';

function App() {
  const handleBookingClick = () => {
    console.log('Booking initiated - will integrate booking widget in Epic 3');
  };

  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen">
      <HeroSection
        tagline="Groomed. Poured. Perfected."

```typescript
import { HeroSection } from '@/components/HeroSection';
import { ServicesSection } from '@/components/ServicesSection';
import { AboutSection } from '@/components/AboutSection';  // NEW

function App() {
  const handleBookingClick = () => {
    console.log('Booking initiated - will integrate booking widget in Epic 3');

- Manual verification via Playwright browser automation confirms proper rendering

**Design Decisions:**
- Used simple `<img>` instead of full `<picture>` element (can be enhanced later with WebP optimization)
- Implemented "RK" placeholder for founder photo (actual photo can be added when available)
- Skipped optional parallax effect (Task 6 marked N/A) to prioritize performance and accessibility
- Used brand color palette per front-end spec: cream background (#E8DCC8), charcoal text (#1A1A1A), brass accents (#B8935E)

**Technical Notes:**
- Component follows established patterns from Stories 2.1 and 2.2
- TypeScript interfaces defined for type safety
- Named export pattern maintained for consistency
- Framer Motion animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for accessibility

2. **AC2** (2-3 paragraphs) → ✓ Test: "renders all three main story paragraphs" validates content structure
3. **AC3** (Rich Keeley's vision) → ✓ Tests: "renders founder name and bio", "renders founder bio with entrepreneurial vision"
4. **AC4** (Day-to-night transformation) → ✓ Test: "renders day-to-night transformation content"
5. **AC5** (Channelside Tampa) → ✓ Test: "renders content mentioning Channelside Tampa location"
6. **AC6** (Founder photo/bio) → ✓ Tests: "renders founder photo placeholder", "renders founder name and bio"
7. **AC7** (Multi-location expansion) → ✓ Test: "renders founder bio with entrepreneurial vision" validates expansion mention
8. **AC8** (Images alongside text) → ✓ Test: "renders supporting image with descriptive alt text"
9. **AC9** (Responsive layout) → ✓ Test: "has responsive grid layout classes" validates grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2
10. **AC10** (Scroll animations) → ✓ Visual validation via Playwright screenshots confirms animations work

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Added color constants for brand colors documentation (src/components/AboutSection.tsx)
- [x] Verified all tests pass (17/17 passing)
- [x] Confirmed ESLint compliance (no new warnings)
- [ ] Consider extracting story content to a content management system or JSON file for easier updates
- [ ] Add WebP image optimization with `<picture>` element when WebP versions are available

### Security Review

**PASS** - No security concerns identified:
- No user input handling or form submissions
- No API calls or external data fetching
- Static content only with proper image lazy loading
- No XSS vulnerabilities in rendered content

### Performance Considerations

**PASS** - Good performance practices observed:
- Lazy loading implemented for images (`loading="lazy"`)
- Scroll-triggered animations use `viewport={{ once: true }}` to prevent re-triggering
- GPU-accelerated transforms for animations (opacity, x, y)
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` for accessibility and performance
- Appropriate animation durations (600ms)

### Test Architecture Assessment

**Test Coverage: EXCELLENT**
