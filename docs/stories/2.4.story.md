# Story 2.4: Implement Location & Hours Section with Google Maps

## Status

**Done**

---

## Story

**As a** potential customer,
**I want** to see exactly where Blade and Barrel is located and when it's open,
**so that** I can plan my visit and find the shop easily.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Location section component created with section heading ("Visit Us" or "Location & Hours")
2. Embedded Google Map showing Channelside Tampa location using Google Maps Embed API
3. Map is interactive - users can zoom, pan, and click "View larger map" to open in Google Maps
4. Full street address displayed prominently near map
5. Operating hours displayed clearly (format: "Monday-Friday: 9am-7pm" or similar)
6. Hours differentiated for barbershop vs. bar if applicable (e.g., "Barbershop: 9am-6pm, Bar: 4pm-11pm")
7. Parking information included (e.g., "Street parking available, nearby garage at...")
8. Phone number and email contact displayed for quick reference
9. Map and contact info are responsive - map resizes on mobile, contact info remains readable
10. Section maintains accessibility - map has proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

[Source: Story 2.3 Dev Agent Record]

Story 2.3 successfully established component patterns that Story 2.4 will follow:

- **Component Structure**: TypeScript interfaces, named exports, functional components
- **Framer Motion Animations**: Scroll-triggered animations using `motion.section` with `initial`/`whileInView` props
- **Accessibility**: `useReducedMotion()` hook to respect user preferences
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind breakpoint classes (sm, md, lg) for mobile-first responsive layouts
- **Testing Patterns**: React Testing Library with Vitest for component tests

**Key Patterns to Reuse**:
```typescript
// Component structure from previous sections
import { motion, useReducedMotion } from 'framer-motion';

export function LocationSection() {
  const shouldReduceMotion = useReducedMotion();

  return (
    <motion.section
      initial={shouldReduceMotion ? {} : { opacity: 0, y: 30 }}
      whileInView={shouldReduceMotion ? {} : { opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
      viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.3 }}
      transition={{ duration: 0.6 }}
      className="py-16 md:py-24 bg-dark"
      aria-label="Location and Hours"
    >
      {/* Content */}
    </motion.section>
  );
}
```

### Component Architecture

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Component Organization, architecture/components.md#GoogleMapEmbed]

**Component File Location**: `/src/components/LocationSection.tsx`

**Component Structure Pattern**:
```typescript
// LocationSection.tsx
import { motion, useReducedMotion } from 'framer-motion';

interface LocationSectionProps {
  className?: string;
}

export function LocationSection({ className }: LocationSectionProps = {}) {
  const shouldReduceMotion = useReducedMotion();

  return (
    <motion.section
      initial={shouldReduceMotion ? {} : { opacity: 0, y: 30 }}
      whileInView={shouldReduceMotion ? {} : { opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
      viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.3 }}
      transition={{ duration: 0.6 }}
      className={`py-16 md:py-24 px-4 md:px-8 bg-[#2C3539] ${className || ''}`}
      aria-label="Location and Hours"
    >
      <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto">
        {/* Two-column grid layout */}
        <div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-12 items-start">
          {/* Business info (left on desktop, top on mobile) */}
          <motion.div
            initial={shouldReduceMotion ? {} : { opacity: 0, x: -30 }}
            whileInView={shouldReduceMotion ? {} : { opacity: 1, x: 0 }}
            viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.3 }}
            transition={{ duration: 0.6, delay: 0.2 }}
          >
            <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold mb-6 text-[#E8DCC8]">Visit Us</h2>

            {/* Address */}
            <address className="not-italic mb-6">
              {/* Address content */}
            </address>

            {/* Hours */}
            <div className="mb-6">
              {/* Hours content */}
            </div>

            {/* Contact */}
            <div className="mb-6">
              {/* Phone and email links */}
            </div>

            {/* Parking */}
            <div>
              {/* Parking info */}
            </div>
          </motion.div>

          {/* Google Maps (right on desktop, bottom on mobile) */}
          <motion.div
            initial={shouldReduceMotion ? {} : { opacity: 0, x: 30 }}
            whileInView={shouldReduceMotion ? {} : { opacity: 1, x: 0 }}
            viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.3 }}
            transition={{ duration: 0.6, delay: 0.4 }}
            className="relative"
          >
            {/* Google Maps iframe */}
          </motion.div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </motion.section>
  );
}
```

**Key Patterns**:
- Use TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Export as named export (not default)
- Use Framer Motion for scroll-triggered animations with separate info/map animations
- Responsive design with Tailwind mobile-first approach (grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2)
- Semantic HTML (`<section>`, `<h2>`, `<address>`) with ARIA labels
- Dark background (#2C3539) for visual contrast with previous sections

- **Features**: Interactive (zoom, pan), "View larger map" opens Google Maps app/website

**Responsive Breakpoints** (Tailwind defaults):
- Mobile: `< 640px` (sm breakpoint)
- Tablet: `640px - 1024px` (md to lg breakpoints)
- Desktop: `> 1024px` (lg+ breakpoints)

**Animation Patterns**:
- Scroll-triggered animations using `whileInView` with `viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.3 }}`
- Separate animations for business info (fade-in-left) and map (fade-in-right) with staggered delays
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` using `useReducedMotion()` hook

---

### Business Information Requirements

[Source: docs/prd/epic-2-content-storytelling-experience.md, docs/front-end-spec.md#Layout 5: Location & Hours, deployment-guide.md]

**Location Information**:
- **Business Name**: Blade and Barrel
- **Address**: 232 N 11th St, Tampa, FL 33602
- **Phone**: 813-874-1508 (clickable tel: link on mobile)
- **Email**: help@bladeandbarrel.com (clickable mailto: link)

**Operating Hours**:
- **Note**: Operating hours need to be confirmed with business owner
- **Format Option 1**: Single hours for entire operation (e.g., "Monday-Friday: 9am-7pm, Saturday: 10am-6pm, Sunday: Closed")
- **Format Option 2**: Differentiated hours for barbershop vs. bar (e.g., "Barbershop: 9am-6pm Mon-Sat, Bar: 4pm-11pm Mon-Sat, Sunday: Closed")
- **Implementation**: Use actual hours provided by business owner (pending confirmation)

**Parking Information**:
- **Note**: Parking details need to be confirmed for Channelside location
- Example format: "Street parking available on [street name]. Nearby public garage at [location]."
- **Implementation**: Use actual parking details once confirmed

**"Get Directions" Link**:
- Desktop: Opens Google Maps in new tab with directions
- Mobile: Opens native Google Maps or Apple Maps app
- **Implementation**: Use `https://www.google.com/maps/dir/?api=1&destination=232+N+11th+St+Tampa+FL+33602`

### Styling Guidelines

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md, docs/front-end-spec.md#Branding & Style Guide, docs/front-end-spec.md#Layout 5: Location & Hours]

**Tailwind CSS Classes for LocationSection**:

**Section Container**:
- `py-16 md:py-24`: Vertical padding (80px desktop, 48px mobile)
- `px-4 md:px-8`: Horizontal padding
- `max-w-7xl mx-auto`: Max width with centered layout
- `bg-[#2C3539]`: Dark slate background for contrast (per front-end spec Layout 5)

**Grid Layout**:
- `grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-12`: Two-column desktop, single-column mobile
- `items-start`: Top-align info and map (map may be taller)

**Section Heading**:
- `text-3xl md:text-4xl`: Responsive font sizing (32px mobile, 48px desktop)
- `font-bold`: Bold weight
- `mb-6`: Margin bottom for spacing
- `text-[#E8DCC8]`: Cream/bone color for contrast on dark background

**Business Info Text**:
- `text-base md:text-lg`: Responsive body text (16px mobile, 18px desktop)
- `leading-relaxed`: Line height 1.6 for readability
- `text-[#E8DCC8]`: Cream/bone color for body text
- `mb-6`: Margin bottom between info blocks

**Links (Phone, Email, "Get Directions")**:
- Default: `text-[#E8DCC8]` (cream/bone)
- Hover: `hover:text-[#B8935E]` (brass accent)
- `transition-colors duration-200`: Smooth color transition
- `underline` or `hover:underline`: Clear link indicator

**Google Maps iframe**:
- `rounded-lg`: Rounded corners
- `shadow-lg`: Drop shadow for elevation
- `w-full h-full`: Responsive sizing
- `aspect-video` (16:9 desktop) or `aspect-[4/3]` (4:3 mobile)

**Color Palette** (from front-end spec):
- **Background Dark (Section)**: `#2C3539` (Dark slate) - Primary dark section background
- **Background Light (Text)**: `#E8DCC8` (Cream/bone) - Typography on dark surfaces
- **Accent**: `#B8935E` (Brass/gold) - Links hover state, interactive elements
- **Primary**: `#B85C3C` (Burnt orange/rust) - Optional accent for "Get Directions" button

### Google Maps Embed Implementation

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, docs/front-end-spec.md#Layout 5: Location & Hours, architecture/components.md#GoogleMapEmbed]

**Google Maps Embed API - Free Static Embed**:
- **No API key required** for basic iframe embeds
- **No billing** for embed-only usage (per tech stack document)
- **Interactive features**: Zoom, pan, "View larger map" link (default behavior)

**Generating Embed Code**:
1. Go to [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps)
2. Search for "232 N 11th St, Tampa, FL 33602" (Blade and Barrel address)
3. Click "Share" â†’ "Embed a map"
4. Copy iframe code
5. Extract `src` URL and use in component

**Note**: The Dev Agent should generate the actual embed iframe code during implementation by following the steps above with the real address.

**Example iframe Implementation**:
```typescript
<iframe
  src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3526...." // Actual embed URL
  title="Blade and Barrel location map"
  className="w-full h-full rounded-lg shadow-lg"
  style={{ border: 0, aspectRatio: '16/9' }}
  allowFullScreen
  loading="lazy"
  referrerPolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"
/>
```

**Lazy Loading Strategy**:
- Use Intersection Observer to load iframe only when section enters viewport
- Improves initial page load performance
- Placeholder: Gray box with address text while loading

**Responsive iframe Sizing**:
- Desktop: 16:9 aspect ratio (`aspect-video`)
- Mobile: 4:3 aspect ratio (`aspect-[4/3]`) or full-width with fixed height
- Ensure iframe remains interactive on touch devices

**Accessibility**:
- **iframe title attribute**: Required for screen readers (`title="Blade and Barrel location map"`)
- **Text address above/beside map**: Users who can't interact with iframe can still read address
- **"Get Directions" link fallback**: Opens Google Maps if iframe fails

---

### Framer Motion Animation Patterns

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, Story 2.3 implementation]

**Scroll-Triggered Section Animation**:
```typescript
<motion.section
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 30 }}
  whileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.3 }}  // Trigger when 30% visible
  transition={{ duration: 0.6, ease: 'easeOut' }}
  className="py-16..."
  aria-label="Location and Hours"
>
```

**Staggered Info and Map Animations**:
```typescript
// Business info (fade-in-left)
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, x: -30 }}
  whileInView={{ opacity: 1, x: 0 }}
  viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.3 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.6, delay: 0.2 }}
>
  {/* Info content */}
</motion.div>

// Google Maps (fade-in-right)
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, x: 30 }}
  whileInView={{ opacity: 1, x: 0 }}
  viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.3 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.6, delay: 0.4 }}
>
  {/* Map iframe */}
</motion.div>
```

**Accessibility - Respect prefers-reduced-motion**:
```typescript
import { useReducedMotion } from 'framer-motion';

export function LocationSection() {
  const shouldReduceMotion = useReducedMotion();

  const animationProps = shouldReduceMotion
    ? {}  // No animation
    : {
        initial: { opacity: 0, y: 30 },
        whileInView: { opacity: 1, y: 0 }
      };

  return <motion.section {...animationProps}>...</motion.section>;
}
```

**Animation Best Practices**:
- Use `whileInView` for scroll-triggered animations
- Set `viewport={{ once: true }}` to animate only on first scroll (performance)
- Set `viewport={{ amount: 0.3 }}` to trigger when 30% of element is visible
- Use GPU-accelerated properties: `opacity`, `x`, `y` (transform)
- Duration: 600ms for section reveals (responsive feel)
- Stagger delays: 200ms between info and map animations

---

### Accessibility Requirements

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md, docs/front-end-spec.md#Accessibility Requirements]

**Semantic HTML**:
- Use `<section>` element for semantic sectioning
- Use `<h2>` for section heading ("Visit Us" follows h1 in HeroSection)
- Use `<address>` element for business address (proper semantic HTML)
- Use `<a>` tags for phone (tel:) and email (mailto:) links

**ARIA Labels**:
- Add `aria-label="Location and Hours"` to section element
- Add `title="Blade and Barrel location map"` to iframe for screen readers
- Ensure links have descriptive text (not just "Click here")

**Text Contrast**:
- Ensure all text meets WCAG AA contrast ratio (4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for large text)
- Test color combinations: cream text (#E8DCC8) on dark slate background (#2C3539)
- Cream text on dark slate provides sufficient contrast (â‰¥ 7:1 ratio)

**Motion Accessibility**:
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` user preference
- Use Framer Motion's `useReducedMotion()` hook
- Conditionally disable animations for users who prefer less motion

**Keyboard Navigation**:
- Phone and email links are keyboard-accessible (tab to focus, Enter to activate)
- "Get Directions" button/link is keyboard-accessible
- iframe can receive focus and be interacted with via keyboard (native browser behavior)
- Ensure visible focus indicators on all interactive elements

**Mobile Accessibility**:
- Phone number uses `tel:` link for tap-to-call functionality
- Email uses `mailto:` link for tap-to-email functionality
- "Get Directions" opens native maps app on mobile devices
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px

---

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Testing Framework**:

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-08

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Grade: EXCELLENT**

The LocationSection component demonstrates exceptional implementation quality, following all established architectural patterns from previous stories (2.1-2.3). The code is clean, well-structured, and maintainable with comprehensive TypeScript typing and semantic HTML.

**Key Strengths:**
- Consistent component architecture (TypeScript interfaces, named exports, Framer Motion patterns)
- Excellent accessibility implementation (ARIA labels, semantic HTML, WCAG AA contrast compliance)
- Strong responsive design using mobile-first Tailwind approach
- Performance optimizations (native iframe lazy loading)
- Security best practices (rel="noopener noreferrer" on external links)
- Comprehensive test coverage (16 tests, all passing)

**Implementation Highlights:**
- Clean separation of concerns with business info, contact, hours, parking sections
- Proper use of semantic HTML elements (`<section>`, `<address>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`)
- Responsive grid layout with appropriate breakpoints (grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2)
- Staggered Framer Motion animations with useReducedMotion accessibility hook
- Interactive Google Maps embed with proper accessibility attributes

### Refactoring Performed

**No refactoring required.** The implementation is production-ready as-is.

**Positive Deviation Identified:**
- **File**: src/components/LocationSection.tsx:116
  - **Deviation**: Story Task 3 specified "Implement lazy loading via Intersection Observer"
  - **Actual Implementation**: Used native iframe `loading="lazy"` attribute instead
  - **Why This Is Better**: Native lazy loading is the modern best practice - requires zero JavaScript, better browser performance, simpler code maintenance, achieves identical UX goal
  - **Decision**: Approve deviation as superior implementation choice

### Security Review

**Security Posture: EXCELLENT**

**Threat Model Review:**
- **Component Type**: Static content display (location, hours, contact info)
- **Attack Surface**: Minimal (no user input, no authentication, no data processing)
- **Risk Level**: LOW

**Security Controls Validated:**

1. **External Link Security** âœ“
   - "Get Directions" link includes `rel="noopener noreferrer"` (LocationSection.tsx:44)
   - Prevents window.opener exploitation and referrer leakage
   - **Status**: Properly implemented

2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** âœ“
   - All content is static strings (no user input)
   - No dangerouslySetInnerHTML usage
   - React's built-in XSS protection active
   - **Status**: No XSS risk

3. **Third-Party Embed Security** âœ“
   - Google Maps iframe uses official Google Embed API
   - iframe src is static (no dynamic URL construction)
   - No postMessage vulnerabilities
   - **Status**: Secure

4. **Data Exposure** âœ“
   - Business info (address, phone, email) is public information (intentionally displayed)
   - No sensitive data exposure
   - **Status**: Appropriate for public-facing website

**Findings:**
- **Critical Issues**: None
- **High Issues**: None
- **Medium Issues**: None
- **Low Issues**: None

**Security Recommendations:**
- No immediate security improvements needed
- Component follows security best practices

### Performance Considerations

**Performance Assessment: EXCELLENT**

**Load Performance:**
- **Lazy Loading**: âœ“ Google Maps iframe uses native `loading="lazy"` attribute
  - Iframe loads only when scrolled into viewport
  - Saves ~200KB initial page load bandwidth
  - Improves Time to Interactive (TTI)

**Runtime Performance:**
- **Animation Performance**: âœ“ Framer Motion uses GPU-accelerated properties
  - `opacity` and `transform` (x, y) are composited on GPU
  - 60fps smooth animations on modern devices
  - Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` via useReducedMotion hook

**Bundle Size Impact:**
- **Component Size**: ~3KB (125 lines of TypeScript)
- **Dependencies**: Framer Motion already imported by other components (no additional bundle cost)
- **Impact**: Negligible

**Rendering Performance:**
- **Re-render Optimization**: Component is stateless (no unnecessary re-renders)
- **Memoization**: Not needed (static content, no expensive computations)

**Network Performance:**
- **Google Maps Embed**: External resource loaded lazily (minimal impact on initial load)
- **No additional API calls**: All content is static

**Measured Performance:**
- **Test Execution**: 573ms for 16 tests (fast component render time)
- **Expected Production**: First render <50ms on modern devices

**Performance Recommendations:**
- Current implementation is optimal
- No performance improvements needed
