### Component Architecture

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Component Template]

**Component Structure Best Practices:**

```typescript
// Example structure for App.tsx or extracted HeroSection component
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

export function App() {
  return (
    <motion.div
      initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
      transition={{ duration: 0.8 }}
      className="relative h-screen flex items-center justify-center"
    >
      {/* Hero background image with WebP fallback */}
      <picture>
        <source srcSet="/images/hero.webp" type="image/webp" />
        <img
          src="/images/hero.jpg"
          alt="Blade and Barrel interior"
          className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full object-cover"
        />
      </picture>

      {/* Content overlay */}
      <div className="relative z-10 text-center text-white px-4">
        <img
          src="/images/logo.svg"
          alt="Blade and Barrel Logo"
          className="w-48 h-48 mx-auto mb-8"
        />
        <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl lg:text-7xl font-bold mb-4">
          Groomed. Poured. Perfected.
        </h1>
        <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-6">
          Coming Soon - Grand Opening 2025
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg md:text-xl">
          Tampa's premier barbershop meets neighborhood bar. Channelside District.
        </p>
      </div>
    </motion.div>
  );
}
```

**Key Patterns:**
- Use `<picture>` element for WebP with fallback [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Component Template]
- Framer Motion for entrance animations (`initial`, `animate`, `transition`)
- Responsive typography with Tailwind breakpoints (`text-4xl md:text-6xl lg:text-7xl`)
- Absolute positioning for background image with content overlay (`absolute inset-0`, `relative z-10`)

---

### Tailwind CSS Brand Colors

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#CSS Framework]

**Brand Color Palette (to be defined or used from existing Tailwind config):**

- **Gold Accent**: `text-amber-500`, `bg-amber-500` (or custom `text-gold` if defined in `tailwind.config.js`)
- **Dark Background**: `bg-slate-900`, `bg-gray-900`, `bg-zinc-900`
- **Light Text**: `text-slate-100`, `text-white`
- **Nautical Accents**: Navy blues (`bg-blue-900`, `text-blue-700`) or teal (`bg-teal-800`)

**Responsive Breakpoints:**
- `sm`: 640px
- `md`: 768px
- `lg`: 1024px
- `xl`: 1280px

**Example Usage:**
```html
<h1 class="text-4xl sm:text-5xl md:text-6xl lg:text-7xl font-bold text-amber-500">
  Groomed. Poured. Perfected.
</h1>
```

---

### SEO Meta Tags Structure

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Analytics]

**Required Meta Tags in `index.html`:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

  <!-- Primary Meta Tags -->
  <title>Blade and Barrel - Coming Soon | Tampa's Premier Barbershop & Bar</title>
  <meta name="title" content="Blade and Barrel - Coming Soon | Tampa's Premier Barbershop & Bar" />
  <meta name="description" content="Tampa's premier barbershop meets neighborhood bar. Grand opening soon in the Channelside District. Groomed. Poured. Perfected." />

  <!-- Open Graph / Facebook -->
  <meta property="og:type" content="website" />
  <meta property="og:url" content="https://bladeandbarrel.com" />
  <meta property="og:title" content="Blade and Barrel - Coming Soon" />
  <meta property="og:description" content="Tampa's premier barbershop meets neighborhood bar. Grand opening soon in the Channelside District." />
  <meta property="og:image" content="https://bladeandbarrel.com/images/hero.jpg" />

  <!-- Twitter -->
  <meta property="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
  <meta property="twitter:url" content="https://bladeandbarrel.com" />
  <meta property="twitter:title" content="Blade and Barrel - Coming Soon" />
  <meta property="twitter:description" content="Tampa's premier barbershop meets neighborhood bar. Grand opening soon in the Channelside District." />
  <meta property="twitter:image" content="https://bladeandbarrel.com/images/hero.jpg" />

  <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
</head>
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
  <script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Performance Optimization Guidelines

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Bundler]

**Image Optimization:**
- **WebP Format**: 25-35% smaller than JPG with equivalent quality
- **Target Sizes**:
  - Hero image (WebP): < 200KB
  - Hero image (JPG fallback): < 300KB
  - Logo (SVG): < 50KB (scalable vector, no quality loss)
- **Optimization Tools**: TinyPNG, Squoosh, ImageOptim, or Vite plugins

**Performance Metrics (from Lighthouse):**
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: < 1.5s (when first content is painted)
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: < 2.5s (when main content is visible)
- **Total Page Load**: < 2s on mobile 4G (AC requirement)
- **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: < 3s (when page is fully interactive)

**Lighthouse Audit:**
```bash
# Open Chrome DevTools → Lighthouse tab
# Select "Mobile" device
# Enable "Simulated throttling" (mobile 4G)
# Run audit and check Performance score (target: 90+)
```

---

### Framer Motion Integration

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Animation Library]

**Installation (if not already installed):**
```bash
npm install framer-motion
```

**Basic Fade-In Animation Pattern:**
```typescript
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.8, ease: "easeOut" }}
>
  {/* Content */}
</motion.div>
```

**Performance Consideration:**
- Framer Motion uses GPU-accelerated animations (60fps)
- Minimal performance impact on modern browsers
- Animations are optional for this story but enhance user experience

---

### Coding Standards

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Naming Conventions:**
- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `App.tsx`, `HeroSection.tsx`)
- **Hooks**: camelCase with 'use' prefix (e.g., `useAnalytics.ts`)
- **CSS Classes**: Tailwind utility classes (kebab-case)
- **Environment Variables**: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `VITE_API_BASE_URL`)

**Component Rules:**
- Always define TypeScript interfaces for props
- Use functional components with hooks (no class components)
- Organize imports: React → third-party → local components → types → styles

**Type Safety:**
- All components must have explicit TypeScript types
- No `any` types without justification
- Define interfaces in component file or `/src/types/` if shared

---

### CI/CD Deployment Process

[Source: Story 1.4 Dev Agent Record + architecture/tech-stack.md#CI/CD]

**Deployment Workflow:**
1. Developer commits changes to local branch
2. Push to `main` branch (or merge feature branch)
3. GitHub Actions workflow triggers automatically
4. Workflow executes:
   - Checkout code
   - Setup Node.js 20
   - Install dependencies (`npm ci`)
   - Build frontend (`npm run build`)
   - Configure AWS credentials from GitHub Secrets
   - Sync `/dist` to S3 bucket with cache headers
   - Invalidate CloudFront cache
5. Deployment completes in ~2-3 minutes
6. Changes live at https://bladeandbarrel.com

**Build Command:**
```bash
npm run build
```

**Expected Output:**
- Optimized bundle in `/dist` directory
- HTML, JS, CSS with hashed filenames (e.g., `main.a1b2c3d4.js`)
- Assets ready for S3 deployment

**Testing Before Deployment:**
```bash
# Test build locally
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

**Monitoring Deployment:**
- GitHub Actions tab: https://github.com/f0xxed/blade/actions
- Check workflow status (green checkmark = success)
- Review logs if deployment fails

**Rollback (if needed):**
- Revert commit and push to `main` (triggers new deployment)
- Or manually sync previous `/dist` to S3 and invalidate CloudFront

---
