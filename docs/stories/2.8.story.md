## Dev Notes

### Story Overview

Story 2.8 is a comprehensive responsive design validation and quality assurance story. Unlike previous stories that built new features, this story focuses on **testing, validating, and fixing** all existing sections (hero, services, about, location, contact) to ensure they work flawlessly across all device sizes and browsers.

This is a **critical quality gate** before launch - ensuring the 70% mobile-first traffic target from the architecture is met with a high-quality, performant experience.

---

### Previous Story Context

[Source: Story 2.7 Dev Agent Record]

Story 2.7 completed the smooth scroll navigation and animations system, which includes:

- **Sticky Header Component** (`src/components/Header.tsx`) with responsive mobile hamburger menu
- **Smooth Scroll Navigation** via `useScrollToSection` hook with 80px header offset
- **ScrollToTopButton Component** (`src/components/ScrollToTopButton.tsx`) appears after 400px scroll
- **Animation System** (`src/lib/animations.ts`) with fadeInUp, fadeIn, staggerContainer variants
- **Responsive Animations** already respect `prefers-reduced-motion` via `useReducedMotion()` hook

**All section components already exist and have been built in Epic 2:**
- HeroSection (Story 2.1)
- ServicesSection (Story 2.2)
- AboutSection (Story 2.3)
- LocationSection (Story 2.4)
- ContactForm (Story 2.6)
- Header, ScrollToTopButton (Story 2.7)

**This story does NOT build new components** - it validates and fixes existing components for responsive design compliance.

---

### Responsive Design Strategy

[Source: docs/front-end-spec.md#Responsiveness Strategy]

**Mobile-First Development Approach:**

The project follows a **mobile-first design philosophy** where all components are designed for mobile (320px) first, then progressively enhanced for larger screens.

**Target Traffic Distribution:**
- **Mobile (320px-767px):** 70% of traffic (PRIMARY focus)
- **Tablet (768px-1024px):** 15% of traffic
- **Desktop (1025px+):** 15% of traffic

**Critical Design Principle:** Performance is UX - maintain 2s load time and 85+ Lighthouse score across ALL breakpoints.

---

### Tailwind CSS Breakpoints

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, docs/front-end-spec.md#Spacing & Layout]

**Tailwind CSS Breakpoints (Mobile-First):**

```css
/* Default styles apply to mobile (no prefix) */
/* Then progressively enhance with min-width breakpoints: */

sm:  640px   /* Small devices (large phones) */
md:  768px   /* Medium devices (tablets) */
lg:  1024px  /* Large devices (laptops) */
xl:  1280px  /* Extra large devices (desktops) */
2xl: 1536px  /* 2X large devices (large desktops) */
```

**Story 2.8 Testing Breakpoints:**

| Breakpoint | Min Width | Max Width | Tailwind Prefix | Primary Devices |
|------------|-----------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Mobile** | 320px | 767px | (none) | iPhone SE, iPhone 12/13, Android phones |
| **Tablet** | 768px | 1024px | `md:` | iPad, Android tablets |
| **Desktop** | 1025px | 1279px | `lg:` | Laptops, desktop monitors |
| **Wide** | 1280px | 1920px+ | `xl:` `2xl:` | Large monitors, 4K displays |

**Testing Widths:**
- **Mobile:** 320px, 375px (iPhone), 414px (iPhone Plus)
- **Tablet:** 768px (iPad Portrait), 1024px (iPad Landscape)
- **Desktop:** 1280px, 1920px (Full HD)

### Typography Scaling Requirements

[Source: docs/front-end-spec.md#Branding & Style Guide > Typography]

**Type Scale Responsive Values:**

| Element | Mobile Size | Desktop Size | Tailwind Classes |
|---------|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| **H1** | 40px (2.5rem) | 64px (4rem) | `text-4xl md:text-6xl` |
| **H2** | 32px (2rem) | 48px (3rem) | `text-3xl md:text-5xl` |
| **H3** | 24px (1.5rem) | 32px (2rem) | `text-2xl md:text-4xl` |
| **H4** | 20px (1.25rem) | 24px (1.5rem) | `text-xl md:text-2xl` |
| **Body Large** | 16px (1rem) | 18px (1.125rem) | `text-base md:text-lg` |
| **Body** | 16px (1rem) | 16px (1rem) | `text-base` |
| **Small** | 14px (0.875rem) | 14px (0.875rem) | `text-sm` |

**Typography Guidelines for Testing:**
- Max line length: 65-75 characters for optimal readability (test across breakpoints)
- Line height: 1.6 for body text (maintain across breakpoints)
- Heading hierarchy: Always use semantic HTML (`<h1>` through `<h6>`)
- Letter spacing: +0.5px for all-caps headings
- **CRITICAL:** Minimum 16px font size for form inputs on mobile (prevents iOS auto-zoom on focus)

---

### Spacing and Padding Responsive Values

[Source: docs/front-end-spec.md#Branding & Style Guide > Spacing & Layout]

**Section Vertical Padding:**
- **Mobile:** 48px (Tailwind: `py-12`)
- **Desktop:** 80px (Tailwind: `md:py-20`)

**Container Horizontal Padding:**
- **Mobile:** 16px (Tailwind: `px-4`)
- **Desktop:** 24px (Tailwind: `md:px-6`)

**Component Gaps (Grid/Flex):**
- **Mobile:** 16px (Tailwind: `gap-4`)
- **Desktop:** 24px (Tailwind: `md:gap-6`)

**Spacing Scale Reference (Tailwind):**
```
4px  = spacing-1   → Tight internal spacing
8px  = spacing-2   → Icon-to-text gaps
12px = spacing-3   → Small component padding
16px = spacing-4   → Default component padding
24px = spacing-6   → Section internal spacing
32px = spacing-8   → Component-to-component gaps
48px = spacing-12  → Section padding (mobile)
64px = spacing-16  → Medium section gaps
80px = spacing-20  → Section padding (desktop)
96px = spacing-24  → Large section gaps
```

**Testing Requirement:** Verify spacing feels proportional and balanced across all breakpoints.

---

### Touch Target Minimum Sizes

[Source: docs/front-end-spec.md#Accessibility Requirements]

**WCAG 2.1 Level AA Touch Target Requirements:**

- **Buttons (all CTAs):** Minimum 48x48px on mobile (CRITICAL for AC 6)
- **Navigation links (mobile menu):** Minimum 56px height for large touch targets
- **Form inputs:** Minimum 48px height on mobile
- **Interactive cards:** Minimum 48px height for tappable areas
- **Icon buttons:** Minimum 48x48px tap area
- **Spacing between touch targets:** Minimum 8px gaps to prevent mis-taps

**Components to Test for Touch Targets:**
- Hero "Book Appointment" CTA button
- Service card "Book Now" buttons
- Contact form "Send Message" button
- Sticky header "Book Appointment" CTA
- Mobile hamburger menu icon
- Mobile navigation links (all)
- ScrollToTopButton
- Phone number tap-to-call link
- "Get Directions" link

**Testing Method:**
- Use Chrome DevTools device emulation
- Use Playwright browser automation to measure element dimensions
- **BEST:** Test on actual mobile device by tapping (not just emulation)

---

### Cross-Browser Testing Requirements

[Source: docs/front-end-spec.md#Responsiveness Strategy, AC 10]

**Browsers to Test (Last 2 Versions):**

**Mobile Browsers:**
- Chrome Mobile (iOS and Android)
- Safari iOS (iPhone, iPad)
- Firefox Mobile
- Samsung Internet Browser (Android)

**Desktop Browsers:**
- Chrome (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Safari (macOS only)
- Firefox (Windows, macOS)
- Edge (Windows)

**Critical Test Cases:**
- **Safari iOS:** Tap-to-call links work (`tel:` protocol)
- **Safari iOS:** Form inputs don't auto-zoom on focus (requires 16px min font size)
- **Safari iOS:** Smooth scroll behavior works
- **Safari iOS:** Animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- **All browsers:** No horizontal scrolling at any breakpoint
- **All browsers:** Sticky header works correctly
- **All browsers:** Framer Motion animations work smoothly (60fps)

**Known Browser Quirks to Test:**
- Safari iOS: Sometimes doesn't respect `scroll-behavior: smooth` - test custom scroll hook
- Safari iOS: Sticky positioning can be buggy - test header sticky behavior
- Firefox: Scroll-snap sometimes conflicts with smooth scroll - verify compatibility
- Edge: Older versions may not support CSS Grid fully - test service card layouts

---

### Performance Testing Across Breakpoints

[Source: docs/front-end-spec.md#Performance Considerations, architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Performance Goals (MUST maintain across ALL breakpoints):**

- **Lighthouse Performance Score:** 85+ (mobile and desktop)
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** <2.0s on 4G mobile connection
- **First Input Delay (FID):** <100ms
- **Time to Interactive (TTI):** <3.0s
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** <0.1
- **Animation Frame Rate:** 60fps (no jank during scroll)

**Testing Procedure:**
1. Run Lighthouse audit on mobile (375x667, throttled 4G)
2. Run Lighthouse audit on desktop (1280x720, no throttling)
3. Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab to profile animation performance
4. Verify no layout shifts during responsive transitions (CLS score)
5. Document any performance regressions and optimize

**Optimization Strategies (if performance degrades):**
- Lazy load below-fold images
- Defer non-critical JavaScript (GA4, reCAPTCHA)
- Optimize image formats (WebP with JPEG fallback)
- Code split vendor bundles
- Minimize third-party scripts

   - Verify no horizontal scrollbar
   - Test all hover states and animations

4. **Test Wide Viewport (1920x1080):**
   - Navigate to localhost
   - Resize browser to 1920x1080
   - Verify max-width container centers content (no excessive stretching)

**Example Playwright Test Script:**
```javascript
// Example: Test mobile viewport
await browser_resize({ width: 375, height: 667 });
await browser_take_screenshot({ filename: 'mobile-375.png', fullPage: true });

// Verify no horizontal scrolling
const hasHorizontalScroll = await browser_evaluate({
  function: '() => document.body.scrollWidth > window.innerWidth'
});

if (hasHorizontalScroll) {
  console.error('FAIL: Horizontal scrolling detected at 375px width');
}
```

### Common Responsive Design Issues to Watch For

**Horizontal Scrolling Causes:**
- Fixed-width elements (e.g., `width: 500px` instead of `max-width: 100%`)
- Images without `max-width: 100%` or responsive sizing
- Grid/Flex containers with fixed widths
- Padding/margin causing overflow (use `box-sizing: border-box`)
- Text content with `white-space: nowrap` causing overflow

**Typography Issues:**
- Headings too large on mobile (difficult to read, excessive scrolling)
- Headings too small on desktop (lack visual hierarchy)
- Line lengths too long on desktop (>75 characters, hard to read)
- Form input font size <16px on mobile (causes iOS auto-zoom)

**Touch Target Issues:**
- Buttons <48x48px on mobile (difficult to tap)
- Links too close together (<8px spacing, mis-taps)
- Form inputs <48px height on mobile (difficult to tap)

**Image Distortion Issues:**
- Background images stretched or squashed (use `object-fit: cover`)
- Images with incorrect aspect ratios (use `aspect-ratio` CSS or padding-bottom technique)
- Images not lazy loading (performance degradation)

**Animation Performance Issues:**
- Animating non-GPU-accelerated properties (`width`, `height`, `top`, `left`)
- Too many simultaneous animations causing jank
- Parallax effects causing layout shifts (CLS score degradation)

### Testing Matrix Template

**Create a testing matrix spreadsheet with the following structure:**

| Section | Device | Breakpoint | Browser | Pass/Fail | Issues Found | Fixed? |
|---------|--------|------------|---------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| Hero | iPhone 12 | 375px | Safari iOS | [ ] | | [ ] |
| Hero | iPad | 768px | Safari iOS | [ ] | | [ ] |
| Hero | Desktop | 1280px | Chrome | [ ] | | [ ] |
| Services | iPhone 12 | 375px | Chrome Mobile | [ ] | | [ ] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | [ ] | | [ ] |

**Repeat for all sections:**
- Hero
- Header (Sticky Navigation)
- Services
- About
- Location
- Contact Form
- ScrollToTopButton
- Footer

**Browsers to test per device:**
- **Mobile:** Chrome Mobile, Safari iOS, Firefox Mobile

- Sticky positioning works

**Example Test:**
```typescript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { App } from '@/App';

describe('Responsive Design Tests - Mobile 375px', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Set viewport to mobile width
    global.innerWidth = 375;
    global.innerHeight = 667;
  });

  it('renders hero section without horizontal scrolling', () => {
    render(<App />);

    const hero = screen.getByRole('banner', { name: /hero/i });
    expect(hero.scrollWidth).toBeLessThanOrEqual(375);
  });

  it('renders service cards in 1-column layout on mobile', () => {
    render(<App />);

    const servicesGrid = screen.getByTestId('services-grid');
    const computedStyle = window.getComputedStyle(servicesGrid);

    // Verify grid is 1-column on mobile
    expect(computedStyle.gridTemplateColumns).toBe('1fr');
  });
});
```

**Running Tests:**
```bash
# Run all responsive tests
npm run test:responsive

# Run Playwright browser tests
npm run test:playwright

# Run Lighthouse audit
npm run lighthouse:mobile
npm run lighthouse:desktop
```

**Test Coverage Target:** 100% of responsive breakpoints covered (mobile, tablet, desktop, wide)

## Testing

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Testing Approach for Story 2.8:**

Story 2.8 is primarily a **manual testing and validation story** with optional automated test scripts for regression prevention.

**Manual Testing Priority:**
1. Visual inspection across devices (Chrome DevTools device emulation)
2. Real device testing (iPhone, iPad, Android phone if available)
3. Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
4. Touch target validation (tap on actual mobile device)
5. Performance testing (Lighthouse audits)
6. Accessibility testing (keyboard navigation, screen readers, 200% zoom)

**Automated Testing (Optional Enhancement):**
1. Playwright MCP scripts for screenshot comparison
2. Playwright MCP scripts for horizontal scrolling detection
3. Vitest integration tests for component responsive behavior
4. Lighthouse CI integration for performance regression detection

**Testing Deliverables:**
1. Completed testing matrix spreadsheet (devices × browsers × breakpoints)
2. Screenshots at each major breakpoint (mobile, tablet, desktop) for visual comparison
3. Lighthouse audit reports (mobile and desktop)
4. Issue log documenting all responsive design problems found and fixed
5. Final testing report summarizing results and any remaining known issues

**Definition of Done:**
- All 10 acceptance criteria met and validated
- All critical and high-priority responsive design issues fixed
- Lighthouse performance score 85+ on mobile and desktop
- No horizontal scrolling at any breakpoint (320px-1920px)
- All touch targets minimum 48x48px on mobile
- Cross-browser testing completed on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge (mobile and desktop)
- Testing report completed and approved by stakeholders

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### ⚠️ BLOCKING CONDITION DETECTED

**Story Status Issue:** Story status is "Approved" but must be "Review" for QA review per review-story task prerequisites. This review proceeds with findings but story should be returned to correct status.

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment:** GOOD implementation with critical testing gaps

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Excellent TypeScript implementation with proper prop interfaces
- ✅ Comprehensive JSDoc documentation on all components
- ✅ Strong accessibility features (ARIA labels, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation)
- ✅ Motion animations respect user preferences (useReducedMotion)
- ✅ Mobile-first responsive design correctly implemented
- ✅ Good separation of concerns (components, hooks, services)
- ✅ Horizontal scrolling issue fixed (Issue #8: overflow-x:hidden, w-full)
- ✅ Typography scaling matches front-end spec (Issues #1, #2, #7 fixed)
- ✅ Responsive spacing and gaps implemented correctly (Issues #3, #5, #6 fixed)

**Concerns:**
- ❌ **CRITICAL:** Manual testing not performed (19/20 tasks incomplete, only Task 1 checked)
- ❌ **CRITICAL:** Cross-browser testing not performed (AC #10 not met)
- ⚠️ **HIGH:** No real device testing (required for touch target validation)
- ⚠️ **HIGH:** No performance testing (Lighthouse audits not run)
- ⚠️ **HIGH:** No accessibility testing (screen readers, 200% zoom not tested)
- ⚠️ **MEDIUM:** Issues log incorrectly reported "139/139 tests passing" (only unit tests, integration tests were failing)

### Refactoring Performed

**File:** `tests/integration/responsive-test-suite.spec.tsx`
- **Change:** Added `motion.header` to framer-motion mock (lines 41-43)
- **Why:** Integration tests were 100% failing (24/24) due to incomplete mocking, causing misleading test reports
- **How:** Extended vi.mock to include header component, improving test pass rate to 11/24 (remaining failures are JSDOM computed style limitations, not code issues)
- **Impact:** Provides accurate test coverage reporting; unit tests (139) + integration rendering tests (11) now validate responsive implementation

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards:** ✓ PASS
  - TypeScript types properly defined
  - Component naming conventions followed (PascalCase)
  - Proper React patterns used (hooks, Context)
  - No direct API calls in components

- **Project Structure:** ✓ PASS
  - Components in `/src/components`
  - Hooks in `/src/hooks`
  - Tests in `/tests/unit` and `/tests/integration`
  - Documentation in `/docs`

- **Testing Strategy:** ⚠️ PARTIAL
  - ✅ Unit tests comprehensive (139/139 passing)
  - ✅ Integration test suite created and partially working (11/24 passing, 13 JSDOM limitations)
  - ❌ Manual testing not performed (Tasks 2-20 incomplete)
  - ❌ Cross-browser testing not performed
  - ❌ Real device testing not performed
  - ❌ Performance testing not performed (Lighthouse audits)
  - ❌ Accessibility testing not performed (screen readers, keyboard nav, 200% zoom)

- **All ACs Met:** ❌ NO (see AC validation below)

### Acceptance Criteria Validation

| AC | Description | Status | Evidence |
|----|-------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | All sections tested at mobile (320px-767px) | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Automated tests pass, manual testing NOT done |
| 2 | All sections tested at tablet (768px-1024px) | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Automated tests pass, manual testing NOT done |
| 3 | All sections tested at desktop (1025px+, 1920px+) | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Automated tests pass, manual testing NOT done |
| 4 | Typography scales appropriately | ✅ PASS | Fixed (Issues #2, #7), tests verify H1/H2 scaling |
| 5 | Images resize without distortion | ✅ PASS | object-fit:cover, max-width:100%, height:auto applied |
| 6 | Touch targets minimum 44x44px on mobile | ✅ PASS | Tests verify button dimensions (note: tests use 44px, spec says 48px) |
| 7 | No horizontal scrolling at any breakpoint | ✅ PASS | Fixed (Issue #8), tests verify all breakpoints |
| 8 | Spacing adapts proportionally | ✅ PASS | Fixed (Issues #1, #3, #5, #6), py-12 md:py-20, responsive gaps |
| 9 | Navigation and CTAs accessible across breakpoints | ✅ PASS | Mobile hamburger menu, responsive header verified |
| 10 | Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge) | ❌ FAIL | **NOT PERFORMED** - critical gap |

**Summary:** 5 ACs fully met, 3 ACs partially met (automated only), 1 AC not met, 1 AC has minor discrepancy

### Requirements Traceability

**Given:** A user accesses the site on any device
**When:** They view any section at any breakpoint (320px to 1920px+)
**Then:** All sections render correctly without horizontal scroll, with appropriate typography scaling, proper spacing, and minimum touch targets

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Unit tests: 139/139 passing (components, hooks, utilities)
- ⚠️ Integration tests: 11/24 passing (render tests work, JSDOM style limitations for 13)
- ❌ Manual tests: 0/20 tasks completed (Tasks 2-20 all unchecked)
- ❌ Cross-browser tests: Not performed
- ❌ Performance tests: Not performed
- ❌ Accessibility tests: Not performed

**Coverage Gap:** Automated tests validate implementation correctness, but real-world validation (manual, cross-browser, device, performance) not performed.

### Security Review

**Status:** ✓ NO ISSUES

- No authentication/authorization changes
- No sensitive data handling
- No new API endpoints
- No security-related files modified
- Scope: Visual/responsive design only

### Performance Considerations

**Status:** ⚠️ NOT TESTED (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Expected Performance (per front-end spec):**
- Lighthouse Score: 85+ (mobile and desktop)
- LCP: <2.0s
- FID: <100ms
- CLS: <0.1

**Implemented Optimizations:**
- ✅ Lazy loading on below-fold images (loading="lazy")
- ✅ WebP format with JPEG fallback (hero image)
- ✅ Responsive image srcset
- ✅ Animation optimizations (GPU-accelerated properties, respects prefers-reduced-motion)
- ✅ Immediate background colors prevent white gaps (index.css lines 82-101)

**Not Validated:**
- ❌ Lighthouse audits not run (Task 17 incomplete)
- ❌ Animation frame rates not profiled
- ❌ Layout shift (CLS) not measured
- ❌ Load times not measured on actual devices/networks

**Recommendation:** Run Lighthouse audits on mobile (375px, throttled 4G) and desktop (1280px) before production.

### Files Modified During Review

**Modified:**
- `tests/integration/responsive-test-suite.spec.tsx` - Fixed framer-motion mock (added motion.header)

**Note:** Dev Agent already fixed 9 responsive design issues (Issues #1-#9) in Phase 1. QA review identified test suite was broken and fixed it.

### Improvements Checklist

**Completed by QA:**
- [x] Fixed integration test suite (framer-motion mock incomplete)

**Required by Dev Team (HIGH PRIORITY):**
- [ ] **Complete manual testing across all breakpoints (Tasks 2-13)**
  - Test all sections at 320px, 375px, 414px (mobile)
  - Test all sections at 768px, 1024px (tablet)
  - Test all sections at 1280px, 1920px (desktop)
  - Verify no horizontal scrolling at each width
  - Verify typography scales correctly
  - Document findings in issues log

- [ ] **Complete cross-browser testing (Tasks 14-15, AC #10) - CRITICAL GAP**
  - Chrome Mobile (iOS, Android)
  - Safari iOS (iPhone, iPad)
  - Firefox Mobile
  - Samsung Internet Browser
  - Chrome Desktop (Windows/Mac)
  - Safari Desktop (macOS)
  - Firefox Desktop (Windows/Mac)
  - Edge Desktop (Windows)
  - Document browser-specific issues

- [ ] **Run Lighthouse performance audits (Task 17)**
  - Mobile audit (375px, throttled 4G): Target 85+ score, LCP <2.0s
  - Desktop audit (1280px): Target 85+ score
  - Profile animation performance (60fps target)
  - Measure CLS (<0.1 target)

- [ ] **Complete accessibility testing (Task 18)**
  - Keyboard navigation (all interactive elements reachable)
  - Screen reader testing (VoiceOver iOS, NVDA/JAWS desktop)
  - 200% browser zoom (layout remains functional)
  - Run axe DevTools scan
  - Fix any accessibility issues identified

- [ ] **Create final testing report (Task 20)**
  - Testing results matrix (devices × browsers × breakpoints)
  - Screenshots at each major breakpoint
  - Lighthouse scores
  - Known issues and resolutions
  - Share with stakeholders for approval

**Recommended (MEDIUM PRIORITY):**
- [ ] Test on real mobile devices (not just emulation) for touch target validation
- [ ] Update touch target tests to use 48px threshold (currently 44px, spec says 48px)
- [ ] Consider simplifying Hero H1 scaling from 3 breakpoints to 2 (optional, current works fine)

### Gate Status

Gate: **FAIL** → docs/qa/gates/2.8-ensure-full-responsive-design-across-all-breakpoints.yml

### Recommended Status

❌ **Return to InProgress** - Manual testing, cross-browser testing, and performance testing required before Done

**Rationale:**
- Automated tests validate implementation is correct (code quality is good)
- BUT story claims "Phase 1 Complete" with validation phase (Tasks 2-20) not started
- AC #10 (cross-browser testing) explicitly not met
- Story prematurely marked "Approved" without validation
- Real-world testing across devices, browsers, and performance metrics required before production readiness

**Next Steps:**
1. Change story status from "Approved" to "InProgress"
2. Complete Tasks 2-20 (manual testing, cross-browser, performance, accessibility)
3. Document all findings and fixes in issues log
4. Create final testing report with screenshots and metrics
5. Request re-review when all testing complete and AC #10 met
