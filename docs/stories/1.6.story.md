## Acceptance Criteria

1. All brand images converted to WebP format with optimized compression (target: <200KB per image)
2. PNG/JPG fallback images generated and included for browsers not supporting WebP
3. `<picture>` element implemented with `<source type="image/webp">` and `<img>` fallback
4. Responsive image sizes generated (mobile, tablet, desktop) using `srcset` attribute where appropriate
5. Image optimization script added to build process or documented for manual execution
6. Images stored in `/public/images` directory with organized subfolder structure
7. Alt text added to all images for accessibility (descriptive text describing image content)
8. Lazy loading implemented for below-the-fold images using `loading="lazy"` attribute
9. Lighthouse performance audit shows image optimization improvements (score 85+)
10. Visual quality verified - optimized images display sharply on Retina/high-DPI displays

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

[Source: Story 1.5 Dev Agent Record]

Story 1.5 implemented the "Coming Soon" landing page with the following image setup:

- **Current Hero Image**: `hero.jpg` (216KB) - JPG format only, no WebP version
- **Current Logo**: `logo.svg` (1.8KB) - SVG format, already optimized
- **Image Location**: `/public/images/` directory
- **Hero Image Implementation**: CSS `background-image` property in `src/App.tsx` with `bg-cover bg-center` Tailwind classes
- **Picture Element**: `<picture>` element mentioned in architecture but NOT yet implemented in App.tsx (current implementation uses CSS background)

**Key Insight**: Story 1.5 QA Review noted "WebP optimization mentioned in story Dev Notes but only JPG used" as a gap. This story (1.6) addresses that technical debt.

**Current App.tsx Hero Structure** (needs to be refactored):
```typescript
<div className="relative h-screen ... bg-cover bg-center bg-no-repeat"
     style={{ backgroundImage: `url('/images/hero.jpg')` }}>
  {/* Content */}
</div>
```

**Target Structure for Story 1.6** (implement `<picture>` element):
```typescript
<div className="relative h-screen ...">
  <picture>
    <source
      srcSet="/images/hero/hero-desktop.webp 1920w,
              /images/hero/hero-tablet.webp 1024w,
              /images/hero/hero-mobile.webp 640w"
      sizes="100vw"
      type="image/webp"
    />
    <source
      srcSet="/images/hero/hero-desktop.jpg 1920w,
              /images/hero/hero-tablet.jpg 1024w,
              /images/hero/hero-mobile.jpg 640w"
      sizes="100vw"
    />
    <img
      src="/images/hero/hero.jpg"
      alt="Blade and Barrel barbershop interior with vintage decor and bar seating"
      className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full object-cover"
    />
  </picture>
  {/* Content overlay */}
</div>
```

### Component Architecture - Picture Element Pattern

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Component Template]

**Picture Element Best Practices:**

```typescript
// Responsive image pattern with WebP support
<picture>
  <source srcSet="/images/hero.webp" type="image/webp" />
  <img src="/images/hero.jpg" alt="Blade and Barrel interior"
       className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full object-cover" />
</picture>
```

**Responsive Image with srcset:**

```typescript
<picture>
  <source
    srcSet="/images/hero-desktop.webp 1920w,
            /images/hero-tablet.webp 1024w,
            /images/hero-mobile.webp 640w"
    sizes="100vw"
    type="image/webp"
  />
  <source
    srcSet="/images/hero-desktop.jpg 1920w,
            /images/hero-tablet.jpg 1024w,
            /images/hero-mobile.jpg 640w"
    sizes="100vw"
  />
  <img
    src="/images/hero.jpg"
    alt="Descriptive alt text"
    className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full object-cover"
  />
</picture>
```

**Key Patterns:**
- Always provide `type="image/webp"` on WebP source for browser detection
- Order sources by specificity: WebP first, then fallback formats
- Use `srcset` with width descriptors (e.g., `1920w`) for responsive sizing
- Include `sizes` attribute to guide browser selection (e.g., `100vw` for full-width images)
- Fallback `<img>` must have descriptive `alt` text for accessibility

**Lazy Loading:**
- Add `loading="lazy"` to below-the-fold images only
- Do NOT lazy-load above-the-fold images (hero section) - critical for LCP
- Example: `<img loading="lazy" src="..." alt="..." />`

---

### Responsive Image Sizing Strategy

**Viewport Breakpoints (Tailwind):**
- Mobile: < 640px (use 640px images)
- Tablet: 640px - 1024px (use 1024px images)
- Desktop: > 1024px (use 1920px images)

**Responsive Image Sizes:**
- **Mobile (640px)**: Target 100-150KB WebP, 150-200KB JPG
- **Tablet (1024px)**: Target 150-180KB WebP, 200-250KB JPG
- **Desktop (1920px)**: Target 180-200KB WebP, 250-300KB JPG

**Optimization Settings:**
- WebP Quality: 80-85 (balances file size and visual quality)
- JPG Quality: 85-90 (fallback should maintain quality)
- Compression: Lossy (acceptable for photographic content)

---

### Accessibility - Image Alt Text

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md, WCAG 2.1 guidelines]

**Alt Text Requirements (AC 7):**
- All images must have descriptive alt attributes
- Alt text should describe image content, not say "image of..."
- Decorative images should use `alt=""` or `aria-hidden="true"`

**Example Alt Text:**
- Hero Image: "Blade and Barrel barbershop interior with vintage decor and bar seating"
- Logo: "Blade and Barrel logo"
- Decorative background elements: `alt=""` or `aria-hidden="true"`

**ARIA Attributes for Images:**
- `role="img"` for semantic image elements (if not using `<img>` tag)
- `aria-label` for descriptive labels when alt text is insufficient
- `aria-hidden="true"` for purely decorative images

---

### Build Process - Image Optimization Integration

**Option A: Vite Plugin (Recommended for Automation)**

```bash
# Install vite-plugin-imagemin
npm install vite-plugin-imagemin --save-dev
```

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
import viteImagemin from 'vite-plugin-imagemin';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    viteImagemin({
      gifsicle: { optimizationLevel: 7 },
      optipng: { optimizationLevel: 7 },
      mozjpeg: { quality: 85 },
      webp: { quality: 80 }
    })
  ]
});
```

**Option B: Manual Optimization Workflow**

```bash
# 1. Use Squoosh (https://squoosh.app) to manually convert images
# 2. Download optimized WebP and JPG versions
# 3. Save to /public/images/hero/ directory
# 4. Verify file sizes meet targets (< 200KB WebP, < 300KB JPG)
```

**Build Command:**
```bash
npm run build
# Vite bundles and optimizes all assets to /dist
```

**Expected Output:**
- `/dist/images/hero/` contains all optimized images
- Vite generates hashed filenames for cache busting (if enabled)
- CloudFront serves images with long-term cache headers

---

### Performance Validation - Lighthouse Audit

**Running Lighthouse Audit (AC 9):**

```bash
# 1. Build production bundle
npm run build

# 2. Preview production build locally
npm run preview

# 3. Open Chrome DevTools → Lighthouse tab
# 4. Select "Mobile" device
# 5. Enable "Simulated throttling" (mobile 4G)
# 6. Run audit

# Expected Results:
# - Performance: 90+ (target 85+ minimum)
# - Accessibility: 100
# - Best Practices: 100
# - SEO: 92+
```

**Key Metrics to Monitor:**
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: < 2.5s (hero image is LCP element)
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: < 1.5s
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: < 0.1 (ensure image dimensions prevent layout shift)
- **Image Optimization Score**: Should improve from Story 1.5 baseline

**Before/After Comparison:**
- Story 1.5 Lighthouse (Mobile): Performance 96, no WebP optimization
- Story 1.6 Target: Performance 90+, with WebP optimization improvements

## Testing

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Testing Framework:**
- **Unit Testing**: Vitest 3.2.4 (Jest-compatible, native Vite integration)
- **Component Testing**: React Testing Library 16.3.0 (user-centric, accessibility-focused)

**Test Organization:**

```
/tests/unit/components/
└── App.test.tsx         # Update existing tests for new <picture> element
```

**Test Requirements for Story 1.6:**

1. **Picture Element Structure Tests:**
   - Verify `<picture>` element is rendered
   - Test WebP `<source>` elements exist with correct `srcset` and `type="image/webp"`
   - Test JPG fallback `<source>` elements exist with correct `srcset`
   - Test fallback `<img>` has correct src, alt text, and CSS classes

2. **Accessibility Tests:**
   - Verify hero image has descriptive alt text (not empty)
   - Test logo alt text is present and descriptive
   - Verify no images have `alt="image"` or generic placeholder text

3. **Responsive Image Tests:**
   - Verify srcset includes multiple image sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Test `sizes` attribute is present on responsive images
   - Verify image paths match new subfolder structure (`/images/hero/...`)

4. **Lazy Loading Tests (if applicable):**
   - Verify hero image does NOT have `loading="lazy"` (critical content)
   - If future images added, verify `loading="lazy"` applied to below-fold images

**Example Test:**

```typescript
// /tests/unit/components/App.test.tsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import App from '@/App';

describe('App - Image Optimization (Story 1.6)', () => {
  it('renders picture element with WebP and JPG sources', () => {
    render(<App />);
    const picture = screen.getByRole('img').closest('picture');
    expect(picture).toBeInTheDocument();

    const webpSource = picture.querySelector('source[type="image/webp"]');
    expect(webpSource).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(webpSource.getAttribute('srcset')).toContain('.webp');
  });

  it('has descriptive alt text for hero image', () => {
    render(<App />);
    const heroImg = screen.getByAltText(/blade and barrel/i);
    expect(heroImg).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(heroImg.alt).not.toBe('');
  });

  it('includes responsive srcset for mobile, tablet, desktop', () => {
    render(<App />);
    const picture = screen.getByRole('img').closest('picture');
    const sources = picture.querySelectorAll('source');

    expect(sources.length).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(2); // WebP + fallback
    expect(sources[0].getAttribute('srcset')).toContain('640w'); // Mobile
    expect(sources[0].getAttribute('srcset')).toContain('1024w'); // Tablet
    expect(sources[0].getAttribute('srcset')).toContain('1920w'); // Desktop
  });

  it('does not apply lazy loading to hero image (above-the-fold)', () => {
    render(<App />);
    const heroImg = screen.getByRole('img');
    expect(heroImg.getAttribute('loading')).not.toBe('lazy');
  });
});
```

**Running Tests:**

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

**Test Coverage Target:**
- Maintain 80%+ coverage for component tests

### NFR Validation

- **Security**: PASS - No security concerns; static assets with proper handling
- **Performance**: PASS - 99/100 Lighthouse score, Core Web Vitals excellent
- **Reliability**: PASS - Proper error handling in script, WebP fallbacks for browser compatibility
- **Maintainability**: PASS - Clear code structure, reusable patterns, comprehensive documentation

### Technical Observations

**Strengths:**
1. Picture element implementation follows HTML best practices (WebP source before fallback)
2. Responsive images use proper width descriptors (640w, 1024w, 1920w)
3. Optimization script is automated yet flexible for manual execution
4. Test suite is comprehensive and maintainable
5. No technical debt introduced; actually addresses debt from Story 1.5

**Future Enhancement Opportunities (Optional):**
1. Consider extracting picture element into a reusable `<ResponsiveImage>` component for future stories
2. Could add Sharp installation check to optimization script for better error messaging
3. Minor test consistency: could standardize on screen.getByRole vs document.querySelector approaches

**Note:** These are minor optimizations, not blockers. Current implementation is production-ready.
