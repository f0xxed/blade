## Dev Notes

### Story Overview

Story 3.1 is a **research and selection story**, NOT an implementation story. This story involves:
- Platform research and feature comparison
- Mobile UX testing (critical for 70%+ mobile traffic)
- Pricing analysis
- Creating booking platform account
- Obtaining integration credentials

**Implementation happens in Story 3.2** - This story prepares the groundwork by selecting the platform and setting up the account.

---

### Decision Context

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#L38]

**Current Status:** Booking platform is **TBD (Story 3.1)** in the architecture

**Tech Stack Entry:**
```
| Booking Integration | TBD (Story 3.1) | Latest | Appointment scheduling |
DECISION PENDING: Square Appointments, Booksy, or Schedulicity (evaluated in Epic 3)
```

**Critical Requirement:** This decision blocks Story 3.2 (Integrate Booking System), so timely completion is essential.

---

### Platform Options and Research Resources

[Source: docs/architecture/external-apis.md#L101-131]

**Three Platform Options to Evaluate:**

#### 1. Square Appointments
- **Documentation:** https://developer.squareup.com/docs/appointments-api/what-it-does
- **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 or API key
- **Integration:** Widget embed or API-driven booking flow
- **Known Strengths:** Payment processing integration (if using Square for POS), robust API
- **Known Considerations:** May be complex if not already using Square ecosystem

#### 2. Booksy
- **Documentation:** https://booksy.com/en-us/integration
- **Authentication:** API key or widget embed code
- **Integration:** Iframe widget (simpler) or REST API
- **Known Strengths:** Mobile-first design, popular in beauty/barbershop industry
- **Known Considerations:** Pricing model, feature availability in integration tier

#### 3. Schedulicity
- **Documentation:** https://www.schedulicity.com/integration
- **Authentication:** Embed widget (no API required)
- **Integration:** JavaScript widget or iframe
- **Known Strengths:** Simple integration (widget-only), no API complexity
- **Known Considerations:** Less flexible than API-driven solutions, feature set may be limited

---

### Decision Criteria (Weighted)

[Source: docs/architecture/external-apis.md#L121-125]

**Primary Decision Factors:**

1. **Mobile Booking Experience Quality (40% weight)** - CRITICAL
   - 70%+ of traffic is mobile (per architecture mobile-first strategy)
   - Mobile booking flow must be smooth, fast, and intuitive
   - Touch targets must be adequate (48x48px minimum per WCAG AA)
   - Form fields must not cause iOS auto-zoom (16px font size minimum)
   - Checkout flow must be optimized for mobile

2. **Integration Complexity (25% weight)**
   - Widget embed preferred (simplest, lowest maintenance)
   - API integration acceptable if superior features/UX justify complexity
   - OAuth token refresh adds maintenance burden vs. simple API key
   - Consider developer time: Widget = 1-2 hours, API = 4-8 hours

3. **Pricing (20% weight)**
   - Barbershop use case: 8 barbers, estimated 500-800 bookings/month
   - Monthly subscription cost + transaction fees
   - Feature limitations by pricing tier
   - 12-month total cost of ownership

4. **Features (15% weight)**
   - Appointment scheduling (required)
   - Calendar management (required)
   - Client notifications - email/SMS (required)
   - Payment processing (nice-to-have, not required for MVP)
   - Multiple barber support (required - 8 barbers)
   - Service type selection (required - haircut, beard trim, etc.)

---

### Integration Architecture Requirements

[Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md#L20]

**Planned File Location:**
```
src/components/BookingWidgetWrapper.tsx
```

**Integration Notes:**
- Widget embed is **preferred** integration method (simplest, lowest maintenance)
- Custom API integration is acceptable if widget doesn't meet UX requirements
- Component should wrap third-party widget with React component pattern
- Component should handle loading states, error states, and analytics tracking

---

### Tech Stack Compatibility Requirements

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Frontend Stack:**
- React 18.2+
- TypeScript 5.3+
- Vite 5.0+

**Compatibility Checks:**
- Verify booking widget/API works with React 18 (Concurrent Mode, Suspense)
- Verify widget JavaScript doesn't conflict with Vite HMR
- Verify TypeScript type definitions available (or create custom types)

---

### Analytics Tracking Requirements

[Source: docs/architecture/external-apis.md#L130]

**Required Event Tracking:**
- Track `booking_initiated` event when user interacts with booking interface (button click or widget opens)
- Track booking completion (if platform provides webhook or callback)
- Use Google Analytics 4 `gtag('event', 'booking_initiated', { ... })` pattern

**Analytics Implementation Notes:**
- Use `useAnalytics` hook from `src/hooks/useAnalytics.ts`
- Follow `ANALYTICS_EVENTS` constants pattern for consistency
- Track service type selected, barber selected (if applicable), appointment date/time

---

### Environment Variables and Security

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#L19]

**Environment Variable Naming:**
- Use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for all environment variables
- Frontend vars must be prefixed with `VITE_` (Vite requirement)

**Example Environment Variables:**
```
# Booking Platform Credentials (add to .env.example)
VITE_BOOKING_PLATFORM_NAME=Square  # or Booksy, or Schedulicity
VITE_BOOKING_WIDGET_ID=xxx         # Widget embed ID
VITE_BOOKING_API_KEY=xxx           # If using API integration
```

**Security Requirements:**
- Never expose API secret keys to frontend (only public widget IDs or public API keys)
- Store sensitive credentials in AWS Secrets Manager or Lambda environment variables (if backend integration needed)
- Update `.gitignore` to exclude `.env.local` file

---

### Mobile-First Design Requirements

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md, docs/front-end-spec.md]

**Mobile Traffic Distribution:**
- Mobile (320px-767px): **70% of traffic** (PRIMARY focus)
- Tablet (768px-1024px): 15% of traffic
- Desktop (1025px+): 15% of traffic

**Mobile UX Testing Requirements for Story 3.1:**
- Test booking flow on iPhone (Safari iOS)
- Test booking flow on Android (Chrome Mobile)
- Verify touch targets are adequate (48x48px minimum per WCAG AA)
- Verify form fields don't cause iOS auto-zoom (16px font size minimum)
- Verify booking widget is responsive at 320px, 375px, 414px widths
- Verify no horizontal scrolling during booking flow
- Rate booking experience 1-10 on mobile (score ≥8 required for selection)
