# Story 1.2: Set Up AWS S3 Bucket and CloudFront Distribution

## Status

**Done**

---

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** AWS infrastructure configured for static site hosting,
**so that** the website can be deployed with global CDN performance and HTTPS security.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. AWS S3 bucket created with static website hosting enabled and appropriate naming (e.g., `www.bladeandbarrel.com` and `bladeandbarrel.com` as we need to redirect `www.bladeandbarrel.com` to `bladeandbarrel.com`)
2. S3 bucket configured with public read access for website objects via bucket policy
3. CloudFront distribution created pointing to S3 bucket as origin
4. CloudFront configured for SPA routing (all 404s redirect to `index.html` with 200 status)
5. HTTPS enforced - CloudFront redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS
6. Gzip/Brotli compression enabled in CloudFront for faster asset delivery
7. Default root object set to `index.html`
8. Cache invalidation strategy documented (manual or automated via CLI)
9. Test deployment: Upload simple `index.html` to S3 and verify CloudFront serves it over HTTPS
10. CloudFront distribution domain name documented (e.g., `d123456.cloudfront.net`) for testing

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

[Source: Story 1.1 Dev Agent Record]

Story 1.1 successfully completed React project initialization with the following production build output ready for deployment:
- **Production Build Verified**: 143.10 kB JS (gzipped: 46.07 kB), CSS: 8.98 kB (gzipped: 2.54 kB)
- **Build Output Location**: `/dist` directory contains optimized static files
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **No blocking issues** during Story 1.1 implementation

The `/dist` directory is production-ready and can be immediately deployed to S3 after AWS infrastructure is configured.

### AWS Infrastructure Requirements

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Hosting Platform]

**S3 + CloudFront Hosting:**
- **Platform**: AWS S3 + CloudFront CDN
- **Purpose**: Static site delivery with global CDN performance
- **Estimated Cost**: <$15/month
- **Features**: Global edge caching, HTTPS with custom domain, SPA routing support
- **Rationale**: Cost-effective static hosting with CloudFront integration and unlimited scalability

[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#Deployment Strategy]

**Frontend Deployment Configuration:**
- **Platform**: AWS S3 + CloudFront CDN
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist/`
- **CDN/Edge Settings**:
  - CloudFront global edge locations
  - 1-year cache for static assets (CSS, JS, images)
  - No-cache for `index.html` (always serve fresh version)
  - Cache headers: `public, max-age=31536000, immutable` for assets
  - Cache headers: `no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate` for index.html

**S3 Configuration:**
- Bucket must support static website hosting
- Public read access via bucket policy
- Index document: `index.html`
- Error document: `index.html` (enables SPA routing for React Router)

**CloudFront Configuration:**
- Origin: S3 website endpoint (not REST API endpoint)
- Origin Protocol: HTTP only (S3 website endpoints don't support HTTPS origin)
- Viewer Protocol: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
- Custom error responses for 404/403 → `/index.html` with 200 status
- Automatic compression enabled (Gzip/Brotli)
- Default root object: `index.html`

### Security Requirements

[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md#Security Requirements]

**HTTPS Enforcement:**
- CloudFront must redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS
- Default CloudFront SSL certificate (`*.cloudfront.net`) provides HTTPS for distribution domain
- SSL certificate must show valid in browser (green padlock)

**Access Control:**
- S3 bucket policy must allow public read access for website objects only
- Bucket policy restricts access to `s3:GetObject` action on `/*` objects
- No write permissions should be publicly accessible

**Content Security Policy (Future):**
- CSP headers will be configured in future stories
- CloudFront supports custom response headers for CSP

### Performance Optimization

[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md#Performance Optimization]

**Caching Strategy:**
- **Static Assets (JS/CSS/Images)**: CloudFront 1-year cache (`max-age=31536000`)
- **Index.html**: No cache (`no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`)
- **Versioned filenames**: Vite generates hashed filenames for cache busting

**Bundle Size Targets:**
- Frontend bundle target: <200KB gzipped (JS + CSS combined)
- Current build from Story 1.1: 143.10 kB JS + 8.98 kB CSS = 152.08 kB total (within target)

**Loading Strategy:**
- Gzip/Brotli compression enabled in CloudFront reduces asset size by 60-70%
- CloudFront edge locations provide low-latency delivery globally

### Cache Invalidation Strategy

[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#CI/CD Pipeline]

**Manual Cache Invalidation (Story 1.2):**
```bash
aws cloudfront create-invalidation \
  --distribution-id <DISTRIBUTION_ID> \
  --paths "/*"
```

**Automated Cache Invalidation (Future Story 1.4):**
- GitHub Actions workflow will automatically invalidate CloudFront cache after deployment
- Ensures fresh content is served immediately after code changes

### Project Structure

[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

**Infrastructure Directory (Optional):**
```
blade/
├── infrastructure/                   # AWS infrastructure configs (optional)
│   ├── cloudfront-config.json       # CloudFront distribution settings reference
│   ├── s3-bucket-policy.json        # S3 bucket policy reference
│   └── api-gateway-config.json      # Future API Gateway config
```

**Purpose:**
- Reference files for AWS infrastructure configuration
- Documents bucket policies, CloudFront settings for team reference
- Not required for deployment but helpful for documentation and disaster recovery

**Build Output:**
- `/dist` directory contains production build (generated by `npm run build`)
- Must be synced to S3 bucket for deployment

### File Locations

**New Files to Create:**
- `/infrastructure/s3-bucket-policy.json` - Reference S3 bucket policy
- `/infrastructure/cloudfront-config.json` - Reference CloudFront configuration
- `/infrastructure/invalidate-cloudfront.sh` - Cache invalidation script (optional)

**Files to Modify:**
- `README.md` - Add AWS infrastructure documentation section

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Infrastructure Testing (Manual Verification):**
- No automated tests required for AWS infrastructure setup
- Manual verification steps:
  1. Verify S3 bucket accessible via website endpoint
  2. Verify CloudFront distribution serves content over HTTPS
  3. Verify SPA routing works (404s redirect to index.html)
  4. Verify HTTP redirects to HTTPS
  5. Verify compression headers present in response
  6. Verify SSL certificate valid in browser

**Future E2E Testing:**
- Playwright E2E tests (deferred post-MVP) will verify production deployment
- Will test full user flows on production CloudFront URL

### Technical Constraints

**AWS Region:**
- S3 bucket should be created in `us-east-1` (required for future ACM SSL certificate in Story 1.3)
- CloudFront is a global service (no region selection needed)

**CloudFront Propagation:**
- Initial distribution creation takes 15-20 minutes to deploy
- Configuration changes take 10-15 minutes to propagate to edge locations
- Cache invalidation takes 5-10 minutes to complete globally

**S3 Website Endpoint vs REST API Endpoint:**
- Must use S3 **website endpoint** as CloudFront origin (e.g., `bucket-name.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com`)
- S3 REST API endpoint does not support custom error pages needed for SPA routing
- Website endpoint only supports HTTP origin protocol (HTTPS enforced at CloudFront viewer level)

**AWS CLI Prerequisites:**
- AWS CLI v2.x required for deployment commands
- IAM user with permissions: `s3:PutObject`, `s3:ListBucket`, `cloudfront:CreateInvalidation`
- AWS credentials configured locally or in CI/CD secrets

**Cost Considerations:**
- S3 storage: ~$0.023/GB per month
- CloudFront data transfer: First 1TB free per month, then $0.085/GB
- CloudFront requests: $0.0075 per 10,000 HTTPS requests
- Estimated monthly cost for low-traffic site: <$15/month
